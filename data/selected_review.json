have never found this market to be anything sensational except that when I need something not run of the mill like honey with the comb or something organic, I usually find it here.  They stock a lot of not seen everywhere items and the store appears very clean unlike a few in the neighborhood.","13136":"My mother and I share a love for organic hippie food.  The buffet at Essene is so good that she requests to come here for a meal every time we go fabric shopping on 4th street!  In fact, during the week leading up to our lunch\/fabric shopping date, it's all she can talk or think about.  They must be putting addictive substances in the tempeh.","13143":"Great little store for the tree hugger in all of us. Stopped by here today in search of a particular product and saw many intriguing items in the aisles. I will return to taste the seitan cheese\"steak\" wrap for certain! Friendly and helpful employees too :)","15032":"health food overload. this place looks and smells like the prototypical health food store, which i do not dig. (call me what you will, but i like my health food disguised in pretty environs like whole foods. if i'm going to pay top dollar, i don't want to feel like i've walked into a feed store.)\n\nthere are lots of products for lots of special needs; however, i found that some things were more expensive than the nearby whole foods so unless i absolutely need something that only essene has, i'll likely not return.","22413":"This place has great produce.  For a small shop, certain items can get pricey, but there is a good range of healthy options.  I found organic pears for $1.69 per pound - and they are tasty!  Milk cartons are an average of $4.50 for organic milk.  They even have calestravano olives (the bright green juicy\/sweet\/salty ones).  Great options of snacks.  Organic cereal can even be found on sale 2\/$7.00.  Not bad knowing that cereal these days is an average of $4.50!  Great go to shop, but I would probably still need to go to Whole Foods to do the bulk shopping.  This market is great for a quick stop.\n\np.s.  they also have a hot food counter\/deli.  Food is fantastic, but pricey.  Mushrooms are amazing.","22987":"While I love supporting local businesses and it's nice to have an alternative to Whole Foods, I find this place lacking on quality and freshness. I got a pre-made vegan sandwich from here before and was not impressed considering the steep price - very dry and lackluster. A lot of the produce is bruised and slightly wilted. They also don't carry staples like baguettes.\n\nIt's okay if you just need to stop in to grab a few items, but you'll find better quality and prices a few blocks farther down South Street at Whole Foods.","24112":"I feel so lucky to live in a neighborhood with such fresh organic produce. Great choices for vegetarians and vegans. Also great hot bar and seating area. Natural products also include shoes, beauty products, books and cooking utensils. Best natural foods store in Philly.","33219":"I find that the negative reviews for Essene are quite unfair and so feel compelled to write my own review. If you are coming here to buy items like cauliflower and pizza, then you appear to have a flawed understanding of why Essene is a valuable place. Don't come here to buy things that you can get elsewhere. Come here to buy the things that you can't get just anywhere --- like local raw honey, Fresh Wave candles, those magnificent raw vegan chocolate tarts, a wide selection of lunch containers and non-toxic food storage items, and organic unbleached lady care products (to name just a few things that I like). Even Whole Foods doesn't sell local, raw honey. I find some of the prices to be quite reasonable, actually, or at least just the same that they are everywhere else. If I have the choice of buying an item at Essene or WF, I will pick Essene any day of the week. And I , for one, find the vibe and atmosphere to be quite friendly. Perfect lighting. Amicable cashiers that aren't trained to be hokey and irritating a la WF. \n\nQuite frankly, if you're going to complain about the price of cauliflower, just go buy it somewhere else. And if you're looking to buy pizza at a health food store, then you have delusions about what health food is and probably shouldn't even be there. I'm so fed up of all of the nice businesses that I like getting closed down because most Philadelphians are average people with bad taste, and it's becoming clear to me that I need to support the businesses that add value to my life. So that's why I wrote this review, because Essene is great, and I'm happy that it's there!","33513":"Essene is a place I go to pick up some special items I either can not find elsewhere or I just prefer the quality I get here.  For example, they have the best organic carrots - big, sweet and always fresh.  I love them raw and they are a hummus dipper staple for me.  The homemade carob bars with brown rice crisp are delicious.  The Mediterranean Lentil chips are wonderful and I have not found another store in the city that carries them.  So, I make a trip to Essene every few weeks to pick up my must have carrots and snack food.  I agree they are pricy, but for a few special buys I just love the place.  Must also say the staff is knowledgeable and always very helpful and friendly.","36957":"I WANT to like this place. I really, really do, but I have been disappointed every time I go in. I live very close by and it's really nice to have a place to go to when you're in a pinch in the middle of a recipe and realize you forgot something. However, many items are very overpriced. Also, they don't carry things I thought for SURE they would have. I wanted to get some whole wheat buns. They have to have that, right?? I mean, they sell veggie burger patties, wouldn't they have buns to go with it? No, they only have loaves of bread. Perhaps I was missing something, but no one there is particularly interested in helping customers. Every time I go, I say \"I'm never going back there!\" But of course, I find myself going back and giving them another chance and another chance. The strength of this place is that it is the only grocery store in the immediate area. For that reason, I'm very happy to have this in the neighborhood. I would never do an actual shopping trip here. I would end up spending 2 to 3 times as much there as I would elsewhere. I was behind a man in line who paid $100 for a couple boxes of veggie patties and some produce. I couldn't believe it when they told him his total! Overall, I don't think this is a terrible place, I just wish the prices were a little reasonable and they carried more things. I've often stopped in here to find something and then had to walk to whole foods when they didn't have it. So I often wonder, what's the point?","38520":"Discovered this place during a quick stop in Philly and was very glad I did!  I really appreciated the variety of options here. I went in expecting to be able to get some fresh carrots and was able to walk away with some cooked veggies from the hot food bar at the cafe there. \n\nWhen I interacted with the staff there they were fairly friendly though no one asked me if I needed any help or was looking for anything in particular. \n\nThis is a great spot to grab some groceries or get a bite to eat.  Definitely recommended if you prefer vegetables and healthy meal options over cheesesteaks!","43395":"I love Essene Market! It smells amazing, Most of their grocery offerings seem to be vegan\/vegetarian, and there's a good deal of organic produce. I go there for everything from tofu to lipstick, and the occasional fresh juice or frozen treat. \n\nIt's a little more expensive than Whole Foods, but there's nothing like supporting a small Philly business!","50571":"You guys.  You don't know me like that, so I have a confession to make.  Deep down...I'm kind of a crunchy ass hippie.  Like, I fantasize about vegetarian co-ops (what up, Rainbow Grocery!).  So, in this meat and cheeze addled town, Essene is a welcome respite.  I love cruising the aisles of healthy people food, reaching out to veggie sandwiches.  And the hot bar.  Ohh, the hot bar.  So many delicious vegetable creature dishes.  I can't remember which ones I've had just now, but I imagine that they involve leafy greens.  Aaand there's a cute area to eat inside.  Aaand their staff is generally adorable and\/or comforting in appearance.\n\nYes, it's expensive and I can't really afford to buy much there, but just knowing that's there's a whole refrigerator full of raw prepared food out there makes some days worth enduring.  \n\nAlso...I really enjoy mock chicken salad, and they have no less than five kinds.  Nom nom nom.","50575":"Absolutely fell in LOVE! \nI was visiting Philly for a few days and asked around for a healthy food option and was pointed to Essene! OMG! The customer service, food, cleanliness and available products were all AWESOME! I've shared the website with others, and can't recommend the cafe enough! You'll love it!","50920":"Essene used to be one of my favorite places to get vegan hot bar food, baked goods or other high quality Vegetables\/ingredients. New owners took over recently. It is no longer a \"vegan paradise\" as one five star reviewer stated. They do have many of the same items as before But they also have piles of BOARS HEAD BACON where the hummus used to be. The hot bar is no longer vegan. Instead of paper sacks , if needed, they give out hideous, heavy plastic bags. I do not feel bad about going to Whole Foods anymore. Goodbye, Essene. And to be clear: it was the bacon that was the tipping point.","52115":"I so agree with the other reviews.  The previous owner had a awesome buffet and I would eat there a couple of times a week.  The new buffet is awful!!!  So sad.","58206":"i don't know why everyone is hating. their hot bar is delicious. they have a lot of gluten free items. the employees are really helpful and friendly. i love their selection.  their bulk spices are pretty good. also, where can you get a whole grains self serve section besides whole foods? i love this place.","60138":"It's overpriced, but mostly for all the overhyped superfood stuff.  I'm usually buying whole grains, veggies, and tofu stuffs - and this is cheap stuff.  It's the super specialty health-nut, raw-food-in-packages nonsense that costs so much.  But hey, gotta get it somewhere!  These days I'm not much of a cacao-munching, goji-berry gorging, kombucha guzzling, superfood junkie, so my grocery bill at Essene is reasonable.  If you want a wide choice of clean whole grains, non-GMO fruits and vegetables, and any nut or bean you can think of, Essene's your safe haven.\n\nHere's a tip:  At the cafe, a pound of plain ol' brown rice costs the same as a pound of scrumptious millet croquettes!  Be smart!","65136":"I only went to the cafe part.  For me, buying food by the pound is a TRAP.  Yikes.  I spent more than I wanted to on lunch, ( of course), but the food was really yummy.  Try the \"banana whip\".  I didn't see it on the menu but its pureed frozen bananas and its INCREDIBLE!","67804":"I come here semi-frequently, because of it's proximity to my house. \n\nLOVE: They have a great selection of natural, organic, non-wheat food stuffs. The stuff they sell is high quality, and I haven't been disappointed with anything. They have a great food buffet in the back. Awesome natural medicine, skin care, etc section. Christina from Christina Cooks does demonstration classes here that I have been to. Great community message board.\n\nHATE:  The stuff they sell is freakin expensive. Sure, the organic peppers are great, but for $3 each? I'll go to the Italian market and get 5 peppers for that price! For that reason, even though the produce always looks great, I refuse to buy it there unless I'm desperate or it's too cold to walk elsewhere.","69148":"Generally, the store is overpriced.  But since I live only a block away I come here pretty often since to me Essene is a high-end convenience store.  Beyond that, I'm a fan of the bulk foods, especially the spices.  Getting my spices here has taught me that when you go to a grocery store and buy a jar of cumin or vanilla beans, you're paying A LOT for that individually packaged jar.  Hold on to your old packaging and just refill here.","70162":"I did *try* to go here twice when I was in Philly; however, I must stay the food was buffet and it didn't look too appealing at all. And I believe they had one Seitan dish each time. Needless to say, I stopped in twice and the food didn't look appealing at all, so I never tried it, I just wanted to share my opinion. However, I will say they had a very nice co-op connected to it with excellent choices!","71295":"Every time I shop here at Essene I have a pleasant experience. The staff is always helpful and full of smiles and the local feel is great. They offer classes in the back (I attended a La Letche League class). The food at the back is good but limited to mostly vegan food. No meats which makes me sad because I love eating organic healthy foods but am not vegan so it left me wanting more. The selection of herbs and natural products makes me very happy. They carry a large amount of vitamins and natural products that you can usually only find online. It's more expensive here than shopping online but I don't have to wait a week to get it. \nOverall, I am very happy with Essene and so glad they are here. I love supporting local businesses and it's nice to have another option besides whole foods.","71919":"I may not look like I belong here (with my Prada's and all), but I think my alter-ego is an Earth-loving, Birkenstock-wearing, rice milk drinking zen master. So when I can tap into my inner-womyn, Essene is the place for me.\n\nOn a chilly winter night, which starts at 5pm these days, my friends and I took a drive over to Essene in search of homemade soup. We were delighted to find a hot bar (\u00e0 la Whole Foods) filled with raw, vegan, and organic options. Just as much as I love meat, I love vegetables, so I was thrilled to find a stir-fried veggie selection. \n\nIt's like the mini-me version of Whole Foods. This small and important grocery feels a vintage Raleigh compared to the souped up but made to look basic Whole Food's fixed gear.","73362":"Great friendly place:)   I stop by Essene almost every day to get fresh produce, a great selection of sprouts, as well as an ORGANIC JUICE BAR with wheatgrass (also serves organic banana whips!).  If you are a raw foodist, or just trying to incorporate more healthy live food into your diet, then this place is a great spot to visit.  They carry a full line of \"awesome foods\" brand raw and ready to eat entress\/desserts\/snacks\/etc... and a fairly large selection of other live food companies and wide array of products.  Jenn is the expert for the live food products, so if you need anything in particular, ask for her.  I highly suggest trying the raw cacao\/goji chunks in the case with all of the nuts and dehydrated fruits.\nIn addition to raw food selections, they are truly a complete store with everything from a fresh and large daily macrobiotic buffet, complete beauty and supplement depatment, books, cookware, and a lot more....\nThey have free Wed. night classes every week, as well as various special events.","76256":"Love having this shop right down the street when I'm in a pinch. Perfect for random ingredients, or a dinner when we feel like trying something new. Great selection of tea, protein powder, vitamins, and cereals. Also, great for someone who is gluten free or paleo! Delish.","77926":"We just had to go to urgent care and I'm totally impressed with this facility. There was no wait. The receptionists were very friendly. Dr. Hopper was really helpful and filled with practical suggestions for my husband as well as an expedited referral for Rothman. The facility is clean and beautifully decorated. I am grateful to know that they are only blocks from my home. I highly recommend vybe urgent care.","90059":"Easy shopping, all products appear to be naturally sourced and scrutinized for chemicals before shelving. Making shopping easier then other places ~ recommended.","90795":"While corporations like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's vie for control of the \"natural foods\" market, Essene may be the last real \"health food\" store in the city. ALL of their produce is organic. They still sell stuff by the pound. And they still make and carry a wide array of sweets without cane sugar. The hot bar is awesome and their selection of products is huge. Yes, it's expensive, but far better than Whole Foods in every way. Your best alternative is to grow and bake stuff yourself.","93291":"I always try to support local businesses when I can, so I shop at Essene whenever possible. They have a nice selection of organic and natural products, some of which are hard to find elsewhere. Plus they have a very very small selection of meat\/cheese, so I feel less nauseated shopping there.","94707":"I stopped by Essene last night in an effort to get some basics without making a trip to a bigger grocery store.  On the whole, I liked it-- I love that you can buy their produce in smaller quantities than most other places (and I think their loose spring mix is a great deal-- usually when I buy spring mix in those huge bags they sell at Superfresh, it goes bad fast and I end up trashing half of it).  The hot food bar was good, but pretty pricey.  All in all, I think they have some good deals, but you have to be discriminating about what you get.  Desert Pepper salsa, 2 for $6: YES!  A tiny tub of soy ice cream for $6: not so much.\n\nNote: for any carnivores, there is NO MEAT in the store.  I was figuring that they'd have grass fed\/free range-type fare, but it's a good thing to know before you plan on doing your shopping there.","95744":"I just visited Essene yesterday and it was another great experience for me.  I would love nothing more than to get a job just so I could shop there on a regular basis - I love it that much.\n\nFrom the second you walk in the door, you are greeted by the freshest, most organic produce anywhere.  Essene has that independent business atmosphere, unlike that of Whole Foods (which just reeks of corporate and contrived for me).  The selections get better as you go along - a wide variety of organic flours are available to buy (by the pound), the same with a few types of beans and peas, a great selection of soymilks, chips, and even organic pet food awaits your inspection.\n\nThe only reason why I'm not giving Essene five stars (like I really want to) is because of their prices.  I do have to second another reviewer here and state that their food bar is awfully overpriced.  The same can be said for their desserts.  I understand organic products are not subsidized by the federal government the way corporate \"food\" is, but five bucks for a piece of hazlenut cake???\n\nIt's a shame the prices are so high, but until there are more subsidies for real (organic) food, prices will, unfortunately, remain high.\n\nThe only thing we can do is support Essene every chance we get.  And try to get out the door after we're checked out - and not spend another 15 minutes (or more) looking at the wall with all those lovely handouts and business cards!\n\nIn the end, though, whatever money you spend at Essene is well worth it - and then some!","99184":"I love to go to Essene.  Being a vegetarian\/vegan and wanting to get organic foods in Philly can sometimes be tough.  When I go here everything I want is right there.  Sometimes the people that work there are a little bit snotty, but whatevs it's cool.","103142":"We live two blocks away - Essene is our go to place for vitamins, supplements, and natural foods. It's expensive, so I swing past and pick up sale items mainly... other items like kelp noodles are comparable and you'd only find them on the web. I really like the staff. Very knowledgable - especially in terms of vitamins\/supplements. They have quality, refrigerated probiotics - not drug store stuff. Their folks pointed me to Gotu Kola and Ashwandha for nerve issues and upon further research - they were spot on (at least the rat studies suggest so with some sound rationale for human effectiveness). The place has great feel to it. The cafe is nice as well - I really like the soups. I'm not vegetarian so my rating is limited in that respect.","106978":"I really like this market and would love to shop at Essene on a regular basis, but unfortunately my budget takes me elsewhere.\n\nI love that the market is set up like a mini grocery store, with aisles and a great layout. The space is wonderful and the food looks so fresh! There is a great selection of organic veggies, olives, cheeses, and bulk products like steel cut oats and flax seeds. The packaged veggie food looks kind of blah, but the hot bar is amazing. It's amazing how stocked this store is with no meat\/seafood section!\n\nOn my last trip I browsed the desserts and picked up one of their peanut butter-oat energy ball things. So good!\n\nTheir grocery aisles are standard with some interesting ethnic products and vegan selections that I actually haven't seen in Whole Foods. I also like that they carry all of the flavors of Lundberg rice cakes (another WF fail) and have a re-fill station for organic laundry detergent.\n\nThey also stock French Meadow breads (and gf tortillas which I can't find anywhere else) and unique dairy free ice creams.\n\nI won't be a regular here since the prices are unfortunately way too high, but I will be stopping in for some groceries that I can't find in the other stores.","109248":"Sometimes on a whim I'll take a pal in to show em the twenty-two dollar sauerkraut. It's there in the refrigerated section. It gives me the opportunity to say, \"Saurkraut's still made outta cabbage, ain't it?\" \n\nI'm not telling you that everything's over-priced at Essene, though. I just had to mention that craziness. I really should call my pops and tell him about it. The price of things these days. \"Highway robbery!!!\" might get yelled. \n\n Most of the prices are what you'd expect from most natural food stores. Essene really is a great little place. I always find what I'm looking for, whether it's bamboo dish cloths or spelt somethin or other. I've also made mention before of my penchant for all natural junk foods. The produce always looks in top form, I should add. It's a dainty little section but it all looks fresh fresh. All these things and more... \n\nI think I want a real dope juicer. Like a really good one. Yeah. I gawk at em in Essene. I'm also a fool for all-natural good smelling products, and herbs and vitamins, hippie remedies and all that. I'm one of those. Essene comes through. Never tried any of the cafe food there, but I expect one of these days I will. \n\nI'm telling you, I'm some kinda nerd who could just browse the aisles there for fun.","111895":"I am SO sad by the buffet. Essene is under new management and now the buffet is totally different. It used to feature amazing organic, macrobiotic and vegan food. Now most of the items are vegetarian and FRIED in a bunch of oil. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION to your customers reviews and BRING BACK HEALTHY, VEGAN food. This is a disgrace. Fried food is not healthy. They are ripping people off.","119960":"I saw Dr. Hopper last week and was very happy with the experience. Professional, knowledgeable and him and his staff made me feel comfortable and taken care of at all times. I would highly recommend and go back to if needed.","123104":"First visit to Vybe yesterday (a Saturday just before noon). Overall good experience for an urgent care facility. In and out in ~40 minutes; got diagnosed and had the needed prescription called into my preferred pharmacy. Will go back in the future for my next illness.","124740":"The Mister and I stumbled upon this place and are SO HAPPY we did!\nThey have a FANTASTIC selection of Organic, Natural & Holistic products, and not to mention, a well stocked selection of local Kombuchas. :)\nWould have loved to explore the store more but we were running short on time.","126048":"I just kept singing \"I'm living in a vegan paradise\" in my best Coolio voice as I shopped. I hadn't been here in years and I have no idea why. That will change. Pronto! \nIt's like someone hand selected all of my favorite items and brands from shall I dare say it, Whole  Foods and placed them all in one small perfect independently owned shop. So great. So, so great! \n\nThey have a fresh pressed juice bar in the back of the take out bar which is new from the last time I was here. I definitely took full advantage of that. A small is small which is perfect for when I bring the kiddos back with me. They have daily specials and regular rotating juices. All looked so delish! My green was great. \n\nThey still have tables for in house dining too. The entire take out bar and bakery is strictly vegan!! The girl behind the counter was so sweet and let me try a piece of the spicy tofu triangles before I purchased them and directed me to the sauce they use to create it. Yum! \n\nThe tea section alone could be reason enough to make a trip here. The beauty section is quite lovely and extensive as well. Fresh, gorgeous produce, prepared foods such as seitan goods, faux this or that, veg sushi and more. A row of just sauces from pasta to hot. A shelving display of just coconut goods alone like chips, sugars, powder and oil etc. Oh, I can go on forever! Everything was organized so well. A must go-to for any vegan or health nut! \n\nThe employees were all sweet and well educated on their products and ingredients in the food they serve. Such a great experience for my first time back in years. Can't wait to come back and food shop for more than just seaweed snacks and vegan eggs.\n\nLove, love, love!","128318":"This review is purely for the cafe portion. \n\nI am very excited about the prospect of quick and healthy food. I don't mind paying a premium for it if it's yummy. I've now been to the cafe many times and every time I experience varying degrees of disappointment. \n\nThe items seem like they come from quality ingredients but the recipes are just NOT tasty. I often load my plate with a little of everything and end up not eating most of it. And I like a lot of foods! \n\nToday will be my last time paying $12 for -a plate of yuck.","128321":"Someone crazily referred to Essene as the Vegan Death Star, and I have to say that I now find myself coining the term more than once a day now!\n\nPound for pound and dollar for dollar Essene has a better selection of vegan and vegetarian ingredients than the Whole Foods a few blocks away on South Street...in my opinion that is. For the hell of it I stroll through the aisles when picking up some fruit or a lunchtime snack and I find a completely different selection of \"substitution\" products, cereals and I even discovered a new addition of vegan scrapple! \n\nTheir vegetable and fruit selection is a fraction the size of the larger marts but as far as I could see all of their produce is organic and a lot of products are local as well.\n\nSo why don't I shop there more? Like many others I find that Essene's prices are a little too high on some of the items I frequently purchase, so I find myself heading back towards South Street where I can save a few more dollars. I have to say, though, that their lunchtime selection at the salad bar has more of a variety compared to Whole Foods, but be cautious, it's all meat free.\n\nP.S. - Essene also offers a nice little assortment of eco-friendly footwear and a cosmetic and vitamin selection you sometimes can't find anywhere else.","132187":"I only duck in here when I am in the neighborhood, which is not often.  But I have made special trips for shampoos they carry that Whole Foods does not.  Their beauty section is pretty extensive.  The workers seem friendly.  The bathroom is gross.  But the rest of the place seems clean.\n\nHurray for small, independently owned health food stores.  They are a rarity these days.   This place is old school veggie, vegan, macro-food the likes of which I don't eat, but still appreciate is available for those who do.  Most health food stores these days are less about healthy and more about marketing overpriced packaged condiments with cute Etsy type packaging.  Not the case here.","133287":"Wow, I haven't been to this place in years. But I have such very fond memories of their hot, ready-made food and their crunchy beauty products. \n\nThe only time I'm down that way anymore seems to be when I'm going to Tattooed Mom's, but I promise that I always peer down 4th Street, thinking \"I wonder if that rad place is still there.\" I should go back. I suck. \n\nI don't even have much to say about it. But. DELICIOUS.","139254":"Essene is now fantastic.  The new owners have expanded the raw food section in  the restaurant.  The salads, which are finely chopped, delight the taste buds with complex but subtle flavors.  Some salads have 12 ingredients (or more.)\n      I have eaten vegetarian\/vegan food in many U.S. cities and in many cities abound the world; and Essene's quality foods can compete with the best of them.\n     The cooked foods are also enjoyable with their own complex but subtle flavors.   I've had   the French Toast,  Tofu Scramble, Aduki Bean Stew, Stir-Fried  Brown Rice, Black Lentil Curry, Root Vegetable Patties, Spinach Tofu Wrap, and various soups.    \n      All of these dishes were cooked with a craft that is sadly lacking in many restaurants.   Nothing is deep fried.  The owner said he buried the deep fryer in a shallow grave in the back yard.\n      Oh! and better than even the salads and cooked foods (and juices) is this:   They have take-out.\n       While you're there, check out the organic food in the produce section, the fresh baked goods, and the intelligently procured foods and beauty  products. .         And, no,I don't know the owners....I've been a health nut for ages, and am just glad I have somewhere to go when I want a good vegetarian meal.","139446":"Health foods markets are something that I enjoy exploring for some silly reason, and thankfully my husband enjoys indulging me. We popped in Essene Market while out strolling, with no real intention of getting anything. We wandered around, checking out their produce, bulk dry goods, the bakery and cafe area in back with prepared vegetarian\/vegan dishes, pantry items, and frozen goods. \n\nThe selection of grocery items is pretty good, there were a number of items\/brands that I haven't seen elsewhere, and my husband was impressed with the pets section (and that they had one at all). The produce was ok, but looked slightly on the older side. Prices are on the higher end, but about what to expect from a private, specialty grocer. We didn't try the prepared foods, but I did pick up a vegan chocolate chip cookie which was pretty good (but not as tasty as the ones I make ;D ). As much as I love supporting local businesses, when it comes to household staples I'd prefer to save money where I can and shop elsewhere.","141832":"Considering the proximity of Essene from my house, I do frequently visit there, and I'm glad to have it near by if I need something but don't want to make a trip to my primary grocery store.  I check up monthly on their sales, because sometimes they're very good.  I also like that I'm able to quickly fill up on a spice or granola if need be.  I think when I compare it to WF or the co-op I shop at, it can be on the pricier end but not terribly inflated like at Chef's Market a block away, and some of their products are worth it.  \nAround Xmas time I was having a party, and I wanted to serve seitan joes, but when I realized how much time and effort I didn't have that the seitan would require, I called Essene and asked if they offered a tofu meatball that I could serve in a crock pot.  Well, just that day, they were receiving a small shipment of 6 boxes of Mama Bella's meatballs that were very popular and in demand considering how unoften they have them available.  A nice lady put it in as an order for me so they would hold them.  They weren't cheap at around $4.30 for 4?... but the few vegans at my party loved them.\nI would recommend always checking the fruit and veggies carefully before purchasing.  I've come home with mostly mushy cherry tomatoes and sprouting potatoes and garlic.\nThe buffet is yummy but very expensive.  You'll want some of everything and big pieces of tofu and veggies have weight to them.  The staff have always been friendly and helpful to me.  Overall, I like it.","141920":"Love Essene, love what they're all about, the food is \"real\", organic, you can buy and eat anything and not feel guilty about it. Great sandwiches, deserts, whole grains, hot bar. Prices are a bit high otherwise I'd shop for everything there. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is for the attitude. I asked where the confectioners sugar was and got a 5 minute lecture about how they're an organic food store and don't sell mainstream items....after further searching, lo and behold, there it was on the shelf (called powdered sugar). Am I the only wholesome eater who likes chocolate icing on her vegan chocolate cake?","143162":"Love all the vegan stuff here! Especially all of their lunch Sandwiches they offer! Some are made there and some they get from businesses, but it's the biggest selection I've ever seen! The buffet is all vegan and great too! This is just a win store for vegetarians and vegans! I wish it was closer, but it's probably good there isn't  cuz I'd be broke! Yeah the stuff is all a little on the pricey side, but you're paying for quality :)","146570":"Nice little market.  It's kind of in the vain of a locally owned Whole Foods.  It offers a lot of organic options and health foods.  This typically translates into an expensive grocery store and Essene is no exception.  Basically I use the place to pick up unique items that I can't get at a normal grocery store.  Due to the prices its not a place I would do a heavy amount of shopping.  \n\nThey have some prepared foods that look good and offer a fair amount of vegetarian\/vegan options.  But like the groceries the prepared foods are also quite expensive.","147630":"Market is very expensive. As others have mentioned, Whole Foods has better values.\nI come here for the macrobiotic groceries.  Last time they were all out of the Japanese Macrobiotic staples. They are in now, but prices are a lot more than what i have paid online or at W.F.\nCafe very disappointing. I was hungry and had to eat some oil soaked vegetables. The soup- $4.75 for a small bowl of warm water with some seaweed in it... So bad I could just eat a couple of spoonfuls. The brown rice was the only well made item that I tried. \nSo it seems like I'll start making my own fresh pickles, and get the  rest either online or at WF.  Beavers Co-op in Chestnut Hill gets better yeast free bread... It's from locally produced, Fresh, not frozen like here, \"Sweetwater Bakery\" bread. Expensive at $7.99 per loaf, but so delicious!\nRegretfully, I don't think I'll be back to Essence. I'm a bit far, and it's not worth the drive! H\nIt's a shame that with this mediocrity going on, the big, mass produced foods, like the ones whole foods sells, are the only winners.","161297":"I'm a pretty big fan of this place! Whenever I'm looking for any vegan alternatives, I always head straight to this store. I love the selection of gluten free options and I feel like anyone with diet restrictions could find whatever they needed at this store. A bit pricey, but none the less a great place. I love their raw carbo squares too, YUM!","167762":"I'm very lucky to have Essene in my neighborhood not only because it's a great place to find all sorts of specialty ingredients and delicious vegetarian\/vegan goodies, but also because it's the meeting place for the Philly La Leche League, which I attend monthly.  There's an amazing section up front that sells vitamins, bath products, essential oils, and the like - it's where I get the bergamot oil that keeps my apartment smelling like a spa - mmm ...  As others have pointed out, the hot food bar is AMAZING!  Also, they have a small bulk foods department where you can buy various grains and spices in the amount you need.  That being said, I would be careful choosing things in that department - I was the idiot who bought the last bit of yeast from the bottom of the barrel and ended up with matzo when I was attempting brioche.  My only other complaint about Essene is that sometimes the produce is lackluster.  However, I have a feeling that this is because they carry local products that are actually in season rather than the mutant super-veggies shipped from all over the world that are available at Whole Foods.  Overall, I'm a big fan of Essene.  \n\nOh, also - sorry, Ali J., but I think it's a good thing that they don't let rats, or any other animals for that matter, into the store.  It's a grocery and they also have hot food served cafeteria-style, so it's important that they keep things sanitary in there.  I wouldn't be offended if they refused service to my two cats.  Just my two cents.","171554":"Great selection of health food & awesome staff !!","172329":"Wonderful product selection with a knowledgable and dedicated staff. Oh, and vegan prepared food section is available to eat-in or to take home.  I'd shop there much more often if parking weren't such a problem.","174837":"Two years ago I gave Essene a 4 star review as it was my favorite vegetarian buffet in Philadelphia.  Now I sadly must demote them to one star due to the change in management, firing of the kitchen staff and the switch to non-vegetarian offerings.  I've been loyal to this place for ten years.  I will now BOYCOTT Essene.  What was once a neighborhood institution is now destined to rapid extinction.  So very depressing.","176907":"I was short extra cash to buy stuff, but, had a very good experience browsing.\n\nStaff was very friendly and attentive. Great sales, too. The one I recall from my visit was on coconut water.  Would definitely stop back  to shop.","178756":"When I go to Philly, this is my FIRST stop. Seriously. My bags are still in the trunk of the rental when I hit their hot bar! Great, great, great vegetarian food.","178916":"Essene is everything I've ever wanted in a grocery store. \n\nJudging from what I know about macrobiotics (I read a book about it a long time ago) there is a hot macrobiotic buffet bar (I hope that I am right in that assessment of telling you that this is a for real macrobiotic buffet bar) (If I'm wrong, it's damn near close to being macrobiotic...like, now I'm wondering if I've ever noticed eggplant involved in the selection). The bottom line being: it's delicious, healthy and almost vegan.\n\nThere is a really good juice bar that includes wheat grass shots!!!\n\nNow we're getting random about my love for Essene: I love the variety of sugars; there is more than one kind of of coconut sugar to choose from! The only meat I have seen is fish and it's in it's own separate freezer. I love the demo people by the door -- there always seems to be a demo person giving out samples of fun things like vegan fudge. I enjoy eavesdropping on other patron's early dinner convos on Sunday early evenings in the Cafe. \n\nThey have their own tofu tub. They have raw, vegan egg salad. There are bulk nuts and seeds. The produce is always a beautiful rainbow assortment of seasonal goodness, shooting towards the bulk nuts and seeds. They have Metropolitan Bakery bread. They make and sell something in the bakery called \"Energy Balls\". I can buy my cat a whole lotta grain-free food. SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF NOODLES.  The personal care and beauty section is not to be missed. Kombucha selection. Aesthetically-pleasing humidifiers. Want. \n\nI once wrote anonymously to them my wish to carry \"Nacho Mom's Vegan Queso\" because I felt that I could tell them this. The cat is out of the bag!!!\n\nGenerally, there is stuff here that I didn't even know that I wanted. And it's all either green, holistic, organic, vegan, raw and always tasting good. This is a [sometimes pricey, but] great alternative to forking over all of your grocery money to Whole Foods, but one could definitely argue the point that it all costs about the same. \n\nEssene is everything I've ever wanted in a grocery store. The End.","181495":"I am so saddened to go into our beloved VEGAN haven to find egg added into dishes at the buffet, bacon for sale and then I was told meat will be added to the buffet as well. AWFUL! All the familiar faces in the kitchen and juice bar are no longer there. WHY WOULD ANYONE CHANGE THE AMAZING FOOD AND BEAUTIFUL ATMOSPHERE OF ESSENE?! Sad and disappointed. Today was my last visit there and I left empty handed.","188472":"So glad to have Essene in the neighborhood! Not only do they sell fresh organic produce, prepared foods, and special diet-friendly goods, they also sell vitamins and other health-conscious items.  Think Whole Foods but around 1\/4 the size and independently owned.  It's close enough that I can do a big shop here if need be (although that has yet to happen) and have a fairly easy walk home with all my purchases.  I also like that they have a good selection of cold bottled drinks (lightly sweetened Honest iced teas) that I can stop in and buy if I'm in the neighborhood and craving something slightly healthier than a Monster Energy drink.  Keep doing what you're doing, Essene, because all the Queen Village organic lovers are onto it!","189248":"The ease of my visit was flawless. Thankfully it wasn't crowded so I was registered and was seen right away. The doctor that was very calming, thorough, and didn't seem like he was in a rush. Everything was great and I would recommend and go back again.","194677":"You had better kno2w what you are looking for, or you will get swept up with hyperchodriac syndrome!! Very pricey, but great all Natural foods of all culture.","205106":"I went to Essene on Sunday and spent $170 mostly on bulk goods to stock up and got jars from ikea to keep it in. On closer inspection that night a shitload of it is conveniently premoldy. Kidney beans, chickpeas, figs, golden flax seeds, and that's just what I could tell from looking at it. I'm returning all the bulk I got from there and never buying from them again, they obviously top off the old stuff with the new and everything is thus contaminated. I called and talked to a manager to alert them that things were moldy and she sounded very unimpressed and just told me to bring it back with my receipt to return. Believe me, i will be returning everything i bought there that wasnt presealed. I am super paranoid now at any of their stuff. And all this at prices that aren't much better than Whole Foods. God knows if they ever clean anything there, sooo disgusting. Decent selection, but I certainly will never, ever shop there again.","205502":"This is a great market for those of us willing to spend a little extra on something like gluten free falafel chips (which are awesome btw) or some frozen ezekiel bread (also delicious).  \n\nThey have a cafe inside that serves up various healthy vegan\/veg (or not) hot dishes and some nutritious and unique salads (definitely not your average boring garden salad).  \n\nGreat for anyone looking for a hard to find item such as Tahini Paste (which I used to make some kick ass sun dried tomato hummus).\n\nCarry an assortment of fresh produce as well as prepared meals and snacks including sandwiches, hummus, and other dips.  There's an entire seed and oat section where you can get self served (pay by weight) items like red lentils or barley and such.  \n\nNot to mention everyone was super friendly and the young man that rang up my order was such a doll.","208563":"Good selection of high quality produce, but like everything else in their store, it's wildly overpriced.","212472":"If I lived in Philly, I would be seen here everyday! They have absolutely everything I would ever need and so healthy and good for you! My Honey was making fun of me for picking up all the natural products like the new types of sponges they have for washing dishes. LOL He said I fall for all that type of crap. I love it! We are both very much into natural juicing. Someone at a store nearby told us to come here to get wheat grass juice. He tried the Carrot, Wheat Grass juice. I bought a pre-made one because carrot juice makes my tongue itch. Wheat grass is really good for you though, and with the proper juicing machine, you can make your own and grow your own grass! Prices were also extremely reasonable and not overpriced like some natural stores in NYC!","226907":"Quick lunch here. All foods well marked for ingredients. Had delish mushrooms almost beefy, string beans and eggplant Parmesan. While it was all tasty, it was all only lukewarm. How about keeping food hot!","227194":"The thing is... I LOVE you, Essene. Really, I do. But, ya see, you are REALLY hard on my bank account. Every single time I come through your doors I am bombarded with yummy organic and all-natural food that I just want to gobble up right there in the store and the curl up and take a nap on your floor --- most likely by your hot bar --- only to wake up a few hours later and do it all over again. But you see, Essene, if I do this I really WILL have to live in you because I won't be able to afford the rent for my own apartment. Sigh...","230577":"This review is long overdue: \nFor quite some time I went to Essene only if it was the only place to purchase a desired item. Why? Well, the people who worked there were sullen, looked unhappy & depressed and generally unpleasant.  Nobody really seemed to care if I shopped there or not - so I didn't.\n\nThen a miracle happened!  Whoever does the hiring now should get a bonus. Without exception cashiers and counter folks are pleasant and (in some cases) delightful.  Now I'm there at least twice a week and love my Essene shopping experience.\n\nThank you for the effort as it has made a loyal customer of me and I tell everyone I know about what a nice shopping experience can be found at Essene.\n\nP.S. Those lentil and root vegetable patties are so good!","240157":"Other than special herbs, vitamins or the occasional voodoo tinctures, I am not a regular shopper here because it's clear across town from me and just way too pricey for my wallet. that said, I CRAVE the hot and cold bar, particularly after traveling or event-filled binges where my body feels like it will shut down if I don't immediately pump it full of nutrients. That is when I generally drag my wilting self to Essene and load up a plate of pretty much anything the collection of adorable chefs are laying down. I wish I could hook up an IV drip to the Harvard beets or the steamed kale or broccoli rabe and garlic, or any of their macrobiotic salads, and I don't typically get all ga-ga for vegetarian dishes because I am a bona fide meat eater. I just have some minor sensitivities so I like my food to be food, and it definitely is at Essene. \n\nHere they don't overdo it with tofu-in-place-of-cheese dishes or vegan chili with preposterous ingredients that don't belong, like broccoli. They're just smart to take real foods that grow mostly in the ground, cook them delicately and season them lightly with more natural things like sea salt, tamari, vinegar, sesame oil etc... \n\nWhen I eat there I feel like that old school gatorade commercial, you know the one where the b-baller would chug from the bottle and you could see his electrolytes regenerating under the thermal electrolyte-cam? That's what I look like when I eat their miso soup.","241243":"I love shopping local and this place makes my body feel good like Whole Foods, but without the guilt of spending my money at a big corporation. They have baked goods (all vegan) that are delicious, as well as premade vegan sandwiches. I can't wait to try them all out, A VEGAN BLT COME ON!?","242219":"Hot bar is $$ but on point.  Heat up a pre-made seitan wrap cheesesteak and dip it in some ketchup. Yum and Yummer.","244135":"I am OBSESSED with this place! It's about 7 blocks further from my house than Whole Foods, so I don't go there as often as I'd like, but I definitely will when it's warmer out & I've bought a new bicycle.\n\nFirst of all, I LOVE being able to support a local business, and their selection (LOVE the bulk section), in some ways, is better than Whole Foods (since the South Street WF is SOOOOO small). The prices are similar to WF (read: expensive), but again, it's worth it to me to support a local business, especially a business that is this vegan friendly!\n\nHere's the thing, though, that brought me from 5 to 4 stars. Even though they don't even have a meat counter (so rad!) and even though the prepared foods section was almost entirely vegan (one vegetarian (egg) item in the 2 times I've been there) and even though their baked goods are all vegan...I was disappointed by the taste & texture of everything I ate there (2 varieties of macrobiotic sushi rolls, chocolate chip cookie, & 4-5 items from the hot bar...all meh, I was so sad).\n\nBut still, there IS so much to love. Super eco-conscious, local, & super vegan friendly. I'm definitely a fan of Essene.","251435":"Essene market has been in Philadelphia for quite some time. All of their items are always fresh. I love the atmosphere in this store and its staff. Always attentive and nice. In other stores the employees seem to hide when they know a customer has a question. Not here! They are also very helpful if you need to call them on the phone. They actually look for an item not pretend. I will visit this store often when I need great fresh ingredients for a special meal. They also have a great variety of whole grain breads. Delicious!","251583":"I'm not the typical clientele that will go to Essene. I'm not gluten free, vegan, nor do I care if my food is organic. The main reason I stop in is because it is two steps from my apartment and sometimes I forget an important ingredient at Superfresh. I feel fancy shopping in Essene and I like it once in a while.","253252":"This is a GREAT, brand-new Urgent Care facility in South Philly!! The office staff (Tabitha and James on the day I came) is awesome, friendly and efficient, and the doctor who treated me (Dr. Amanda Mortillaro) super professional, efficient, knowledgeable and kind!! She was very personable and showed genuine care for my health and wellbeing, and her prescription was perfect and cured me within a super speedy time period!! As they advertise, I DID feel better as soon as walked in and DEFINITELY when I left!! I need to add that the whole experience from arriving to leaving lasted at most 30 minutes, my wait time was under 5 minutes!! My BEST doctor experience in Philadelphia to date!! Thank you everyone at Vybes' God bless!! :-)","254282":"Took my mother there after she injured her foot.   At the time of our visit, it was mid-day so no one (patients) were in there.  However, they were fast, courteous (staff and doctor) and was able to take an x-ray of her foot to determine if it was brook, sprained, etc.   Place was clean and tidy.....Will definitely use again, if needed and they have convenient hours, 7-days a week.","262460":"The best thing about Essene is that if fills a real void in the Philly health shop scene.\n\nFor their small size, they invest a lot of energy into really cool stuff you just can't get anywhere else.\n\nLots of fresh locally-grown produce that's just bursting with color and energy (most of the time).\n\nLocal tofu, a great selection of South River Miso, as well as Japanese macrobiotic, American and large bulk bin miso.  BTW their miso soup is a delicious warmer in the winter!\n\nThey have a large selection of dried Japanese sea vegetables, eclectic salts, gluten free stuff, raw chocolate making kits, dried goldenberry superfoods, nice selection of raw nut butters, tekka and refrigerated mochi, wheatgrass and sprouters.... \n\nThey also carry a big selection of cute sandwich packaging which you can buy and wash - no more ziplocks.\n\nAlso, I recently fell in love with a lactic acid fermented and naturally preserved beet juice, much like Biotta, but a local Philadelphia company.\n\nThey have a nice bulk bin section (fresh oat groats for that wonderful Pure Food and Wine chocolate chip cookie recipe) and sell a good deal of raw food specialty items - the only place in town I've been able to find raw buckwheat for sprouting - and not too terribly expensive!!  (Eden)\n\nBig and Expansive natural body care section, and they even sell great vegan shoes and well... the list goes on.  \n\nThey also usually have a nice coupon to save on your items during the year if you sign up for e-mail.\n\nThey get all the good stuff!","266511":"The soups in the cafe are delicious.  That said, the rest of the store is overpriced.  I agree with the other reviews that say they are prohibitive.  Many of the products can be found at Trader Joe's for much less. The stuff that you can't find at Trader Joe's are unique items that should not be only for those with lots of disposable income.  $10 for a takeout lunch from the refrigerator section is ridiculous.  \n\nBut they do have a nice selection of fresh, quality foods.","267758":"Went to Essene today to find out there is a new chef and s\/he thought it was a good idea to take a formerly delicious vegetarian\/vegan hot bar and put fish in it. \n\nThere are signs available that say contain fish, dairy, eggs in small letters. Take down the big wooden sign that says you serve only vegetarian food ASAP. Take it off your web site. It's false advertising. I had a terrible stomach ache on Monday after eating your food and now I know why. I don't recall any signs that said fish was in the food, but I know they still today have the contradictory huge wooden vegetarian sign up!!\n\nWhen we told the very nice woman at the counter that we could not eat the food she took it away quickly without an issue and was very apologetic. Maybe she didn't want to interrupt me and my friend, but someone should be actively telling people. A ton of your long time clients do not eat animals and loved that they didn't ever have to question dining at your cafe. Oddly, she said she was trying to figure it out if we were veg. Maybe I should lose 30 lbs and wear tie dye mandala shirts so I don't get fed fish anymore hah, ugh. Can't go by that, just please start telling people when you greet them so they don't get sick\/angry.\n\nFor years I've always go out of my way to shop at Essene instead of whole foods or other grocers. I could have gotten stuff cheaper elsewhere, but this store WAS special and I wanted to support it. The vibe\/staff has been weird for a few months and after reading the other reviews I see why...\n\nManagement: I wrote you an email a few weeks back praising your new cuisine. I'm very sad that I have to take it back and won't be supporting your business anymore.","268302":"I hadn't eaten lunch at Essene in a while and went there the other day.  I love that I can get super healthy, filling vegan food here without having to \"dining out\".  I don't recall ever not liking something I got from their food bar.","269829":"when i worked at pearl i loved coming here for the hot bar. i was pregnant at the time, and the lovely smells emanating from said bar were more than comforting...\n\nactually, they were some of the few smells that didn't turn my stomach at the time.\n\nwhen i get all misty and nostalgic, i just bring the fry down so he can pick out a cookie and we can chow down on some veg enchiladas.\n\nreally, it probably deserves 4 stars due to the friendly staff, the great food, and the wonderful drugstore section. that last star had to go down, though, as the price point is crazy high here.\n\nhail seitan!","283414":"Once I came to Essene to buy cauliflower. IT COST ME $13.\n\nI tell people the story of my $13 cauliflower. They ask, \n\nDid it cook itself?\nWas it the most amazing cauliflower you ever ate?\nDid it give you special powers?\n\nAdmittedly, it was a large head of cauliflower. But $13?! Now when I come into the market, I scurry through the produce section, hoping the broccoli doesn't grow arms and grab me.\n\nEssene does offer a great selection of bulk dry goods and weird stuff you won't find elsewhere, like quinoa pasta, rice sweetener, and hemp milk ice cream. It's all flipping expensive, but unlike Whole Foods, Essene is a small business so you feel good about spending half your paycheck on a bar of fair trade vegan all-natural fortified with coconut essence 85% chocolate.\n\nBe sure to check out the vast selection of vitamins, supplements, and beauty products. They also sell vegan shoes and stainless steel lunch containers and all sort of things that make you feel fuzzy about the earth and life.\n\nI'm only slightly making fun. I'm addicted to their lip balm selection.","290080":"Note: I grew up in California, so have shopped at DOZENS of health food shops. Ok, now, for my review.\n\nVery good selection, but they lose stars because:\n\nThe first time I walked in there, a cashier loudly asked me \"HI! Did you just get done having your hair done next door?!??!\"  I was perplexed that she would ask me that, especially since I  had never met her before and I was unaware of any hair shoppe next door.  So I replied to her with \"No, I am here to buy food\" and her eyes suddenly looked as if they were going to pop out of her head and her jaw dropped open.   This was very awkward to me and I walked away.   I did my shopping and the same, strange girl checked me out, and she was very smug towards me.  Soooooo, I did not return for another six months due to the awkwardness.\n\nThe next time I went there, I casually mentioned to the manager that I had initially (when I first moved to Philadelphia)  had a hard time finding them because of their small (low) internet presence.  He said to me:  \"We Don't WANT people from the internet shopping here!!\"   and he  abruptly walked away.  I had just finished checking out with a cashier, so I left with my groceries.  So, I waited another 6 months before going back, because of his rudeness.\n\nThe next time I came back, I went to their cafe.  The lunch was very bland.  Also, I was about to order a wheatgrass juice, but the person behind the counter had such and attitude, that I instead drank water.   \n\nWith the prices they charge, they really need to work on preparing foods with flavor and the rudeness of their workers has got to go.   I would give them two stars, but the employees who work in the health and beauty department are friendly.\n\nI live in Fishtown, and I really wish that someone would open up a proper health food shop\/cafe\/juice bar in or near my neighborhood.","290431":"This place is pretty pricey, but it's got some amazing finds.  For instance, this is the only place in the city that sells Hemp Bagels, which I obsess over like they are narcotics. For various health reasons, I'm not supposed to load up on simple carbs as that makes my body load up on the lbs (even more than most) Naturally, bagels are my favorite!! Moving back to Philadelphia from NY was an easy way of avoiding bagels, like why bother? but bagels have always been special to me even before I ever called myself a Nyer. \n\nTrying Hemp bagels was like a revelation:) They are tasty and delicious and made with out preservatives and have a whopping 20 grams of protein! Now I can get my bagel fix and I don't have to feel bad about it! HOORAH!\n \nI buy a few other things at Essene, but my other new favorite thing to buy here is Good Karma, Rice Divine, Carrot Cake-flavored ice cream.  Whole Foods sells the brand, but I haven't seen this flavor there.  I recently found myself in a perfectly normal dinner conversation and suddenly bringing this up.  I'm told my whole face changes when I talk about it.  It's embarrassing, sure, but it's what I have going for me right now--give a girl a break:)","290900":"Produce usually sucks. Hot food bar is way over priced, bland, and the staff back there aren't too friendly. Cashiers and health\/beauty section folks are nice.","297633":"I give Essene two stars for the sole reason that the staff in the vitamins, skin and cosmetics section are PROFOUNDLY rude.  When I started a temporary project in this neighborhood, I was so happy to find a health food store nearly.   I've actually tried repeatedly to spend tons of money in the cosmetics section but have usually been stopped in my tracks by the propensity of the clerks there to stare intensely at customers and generally to behave extremely coldly.  The most recent perpetrator was an attractive woman with very short hair who outdid all her predecessors in this regard.  I'm not talking about the clearly necessary tailing of customers for security reasons; this is something many businesses have to do.  The point is that all customer interactions--whether security-related or not (and mine weren't in the case of Essene--I don't tend to be unduly sterotyped as someone needing security attention, unlike some of my unlucky, innocent buddies) should be negotiated in a way that is at least baseline-respectable toward customers.  It boggles my mind that this section of Essene (thanks to one or two rude staff people) is single-handedly making me (and a couple of others who had a similar experience) disinclined to patronize Essene.  I'm sad to give this store a mere two stars, but if they don't improve this bizarre sub-section of their store I'm giving up.","302188":"Start prepping your gastronomic vocabulary sheets, it's time to head to Essene! Loaded with more organic, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, free range, hormone-free, unmolested, natural foods than you can shake your slightly funky poncho at, this local food market and cafe is a safe haven for the health-conscious inhabitants of Queen's Village and beyond. \n\nWalk in and feast your eyes on their small, yet high-end selection of vegetables, fruits and cheeses, followed by coolers stocked with everything from roasted garlic hummus to coconut water. The tiny aisles wrap their way around the store, containing a fairly expansive selection of all-natural, wholesome food tastiness. \n\nThe hot bar and cafe are nestled towards the back end, allowing patrons to self-serve cafeteria style and take a seat to grub out. Expect an all vegetarian (or vegan) smorgasbord with plenty of gluten-free options. Buffalo tofu, pickled vegetables, roasted eggplant, seitan-inspired dishes...you get the point. \n\n::Puts on copywriter hat:: - \"Whether you want a freshly prepared vegan meal, local produce, vitamins, or fair trade chocolate, you'll find it all at Essene!\" \n\nPhew, well that was fun, but the mitigating factor and deciding point on whether or not you shop here is the borderline oppressive pricing in this store. Yes, I understand the higher costs for organic, vegan (and on and on) foods, but I can't ever walk in here without getting tagged for $20-30, and sometimes I'm literally leaving with a couple items. \n\nThe hot bar is a tasty veg option for a quick meal and there's plenty of specialty food items you won't find elsewhere, but I can't really understand some of the pricing in here at all.","302687":"I eat at Essene Cafe on a weekly basis. I really like that they have such a wide selection of healthy, very tasty vegetarian food. It is on the expensive side of what I typically want on spend on lunch, but considering the buffet is high quality organic food, I understand why. I particularly am a fan of the diakon, carrot and red cabbage salad (I wish they would have that more often), but just about everything they serve is good. The bakery items are amazing. I also do a good deal of my grocery shopping there, especially for the things that I can't find cheaper elsewhere.","303489":"I'm not sure if Philly knows how lucky s\/he\/they is to have this local market. I moved here in January and have never seen anything like it -- a non-coop operating like a co-op without the pesky membership fees\/etc, and around since 1969!\n\nPros: \n* Prices are actually VERY competitive - better priced organic produce than ACME and Whole Foods I've found. \n* Selection is excellent! I often find foods that are not found elsewhere, like Rob's Vegan puffs and that delicious schmilk chocolate. \n* Yum baked goods & buffet!  Have you had the smores cake? Life changing. \n* Great mellow shopping experience. Unlike WF, when I leave wanting to execute someone, I always am calm Zen woman in the Essene atmosphere, even when it's busy. \n* Nice people\/staff. \n* Water bowl for your pup outside. \n\nCons: \n* Not really critical, but w\/b nice if they spruced up the cafe area with some paint \/ color \/ art.","305117":"I've previously heard about Essene and their buffet, but I never really felt compelled to try it. Yesterday, it was on my way to somewhere, so I decided to stop in and get lunch. \n\nAfter browsing a little bit, it seems that their prices are pretty much inline with Whole Foods. Their buffet is the same cost as WF, and the quality is much better. I particularly liked the stewed carrots, and the fried rice. I'll definitely be adding this to my list of lunch spots in the area.","307572":"Essene sells all kinds of great food and snacks but the reason for my visit was to purchase High Mowing Organic Seeds. They have a nice selection and its perfect for the gardener who migh have most of their seeds left over and is only looking for one or two items so doesn't need to place a mail order. I will definitely be back for more seeds as I run out!","320430":"I love this store for what they represent, as much as for what they sell.  It's a long-time local business that really strives to provide great customer service & products to the macro, vegan & community in general.  \n\nI get that people complain about the prices, but small stores like this just don't have the purchasing power of their competitors.  And although I don't shop here as much as I'd like these days, it's always nice to step inside their doors & see some of the same faces from the early 90s & prob earlier.  \n\nGreat vitamin & beauty department here.  I also like the fresh juicebar a lot.   Pressed to order, yum!","331243":"I know I'm gonna' get yelled at for this, but I am not a fan. The groceries are all well and good (although I prefer the selection at Whole Foods), but the hot food was totally bland. I grew up on health food, but there is a way to make it tasty. Not even the chocolate chip cookies had taste factor!\n\nIf you are anti-corporate and a health nut, it's too bad there aren't more options than Essene and Whole Foods.","332888":"Essene is where I go to feel virtuous, which is, after all, a loosely held relative of smug. It is here where:\n\n* I imagine i'm a vegetarian or vegan, without taking on the stress of actually being one\n\n* I acquire bath and beauty products that are more natural, pure, and socioeconomically valid than the ones you probably use\n\n* I spoon through the prepared foods section, which has featured, among other items, entire heads of steamed cauliflower straining under baths of broth-like curry\n\nIn other words, I love it here.\n\nI love that unlike Whole Foods, Essene really IS about whole foods. It's clear the people running this place care deeply about what they're doing and they run an extremely pleasant operation.\n\nAllow me to recommend:\n\nRaw milk in glass jugs (so good!)\nGreens (all kinds - they're wonderful here - local, really fresh)\nRed grapes are outstanding right now, as is their fresh mango - slice, add lime\nMichele's Tofu Tahini & Carrot spread (makes a great wrap - recipe below)\nLocal Feta (outstanding) \nBoxed cereals (all high quality, good variety)\nBath and body (very large section, includes Dr. Hauschka, a must if you want to be as delicious as me)\nWhole grain breads\nHot food area and juice bar (for me personally the prepared foods are hit or miss. they tend to be super-saucy. but it's \"clean\" and often macrobiotic and sometimes you just need to eat something that's going to de-junk your system. the juices are phenom.)\nThe wailing wall of business cards, newsletters and such\nThe sushi (includes some fish, and of course, brown rice)\nThe awesome employees\n\nI might avoid:\nUnpackaged granola in bins (I want to love it, but the two kinds I got were both stale)\nVegan desserts (tried many, hate them all - however, for those who need wheat-free, rice syrup dung blocks, etc etc, this is the motherlode)\n\nI remain curious about:\nClasses\nGrind your own peanut butter\nThe vitamin and supplement wall\n\nI find myself irked:\nAny time there's someone in front trying to get me to taste and buy stuff I don't want. Yesterday it was giant canisters of protein powder (or at least it looked like protein powder.)\n\n**AS PROMISED**\nRecipe: \"Dan F.'s Virtue Wrap\"\n\nWarm tortilla directly on gas burner flame, a few seconds on both sides. Dollop on Michele's tofu tahini & carrot spread. Add feta, shredded raw beet (for a wrap, i prefer chioggia for its milder\/more delicate flavor with less liquid; go with red if you want more), thinly sliced red onion, cucumber, alfalfa sprouts, and the key: fry up and crumble on some fakin bacon. Fold, roll, eat, then smirk because at least for today, you're not some cheesesteak eating slob. You breathe finer air.","333253":"Alright, Yelpers, it's time for a confession:  I'm new to organic and healthy shopping.\n\nBefore a few months ago, I had only been to Whole Foods for anything health-centered.  One weekend in the city, a friend introduced me to this lovely store.\n\nI was apprehensive at first, especially when I passed the vegetarian buffet.  After all, I'm a proud carnivore, and veggie-centric displays tend to make me feel guilty.\n\nTo fit in, I bought some pita, red pepper humus, and local feta cheese.  I was immensely satisfied.  Since that fateful day, I've been back numerous times and have left consistently happy.\n\nIf you want to try and avoid the larger Whole Foods scene while continuing to enjoy a healthy and natural lifestyle, I wholeheartedly recommend this place.\n\nMake sure you get some chocolate bars and dehydrated raspberries on the way out!","333858":"Walked in at 4:05 on a Saturday, got diagnosed with walking pneumonia with my prescription and out the door by 4:45pm. Staff was nice and caring as could be. They sent my Rx to CVS right down the street and I was able to pick it up immediately when I was sure it couldn't all be done by 5.  Great place!","336419":"I'm pretty sure my husband and I keep this place in business. It is insanely expensive but subpar in a lot of ways. The produce is often not that fresh. Once we got some kind of critters from the bulk food bins and not even an apology when we reported it. The hot foods bar is expensive and not very good. Check expiration dates on anything you buy! That said, there aren't any other good options for organic food in the neighborhood when you're too lazy to trek over to Whole Foods. Most people have been complaining  about the new meat and cheese sections, but those additions are actually a plus for me, as an omnivore. So in short, for now we are still reluctant regulars, but if that grocery store ever opens on 2nd and South... we're out.","337802":"I've only been here once, so I might re-review this place again later.\n\nAnd, for anyone complaining about it being \"pricey\" or \"expensive\"...go to their website and read \"About Essene\" page. I could understand being taken back by what they charge if places like Acme and Super Fresh carried the same products for way less, but uhhh, they generally don't. The fact that you are going in here means you are either being lazy and not venturing to one of the other grocery stores within a one or two mile radius, or you're seeking something specific out, whether it be organic produce or in my case local honey. \n\nThe variety here for vegetarians on a cursory walk through seems to be the best I've found in the city. The staff seems comprised of the usual characters you'd find at a natural food store, which typically means on some level they are into what the store is doing. I like that.\n\nI wouldn't shop here exclusively, but definitely recommended.","341765":"A concierge urgent care clinic. Everybody was extremely nice, and Howard and Matt were excellent, along with the onsite doctors. MUCH better than an emergency room. Excellent staff and service, highly recommended!","341949":"Been in the neighborhood for 17 years, sad to watch how Essene changed! The vegan buffet was the heart of the house, so delicious fresh and full of flavor. Now, all you can find is fried eggs, fried vegetables, fried EVERYTHING. It's more like very poor asian buffet.","346945":"Expensive but they have almost everything.  Friendly and knowledgable staff offer good suggestions.  Fresh, healthy food.","347821":"I always enjoy a trip to the Essene market which is almost always a must if I am getting a haircut next door at JuJu Salon. I like that they carry a variety of eco-friendly containers and utensils for toting my lunch to work. I really can't say enough good things about the LunchBots products. They've got a great variety of fresh produce and an impressive bulk section for nuts, grains, and flours. Their stock of cereals, pastas, juices, and frozen items is likely to have the unique items your Veganomicon recipe is calling for. They also have items that more conventional folks enjoy as well in case you're not into spelt or teff flour. It would be fairly expensive to do your regular shopping here unless you are some sort of super-vegan or have very stringent dietary requirements. I'd recommend using them for the specialty items you may need in smaller quantities. \n\nI have mixed feelings about their prepared foods bar as it just seems utterly overpriced to me. I lunched at Essene with two friends the other day and my plate of various incarnations of tofu and seitan came to over $13.00. I had to wonder if they were actually counting the glass plate as a part of the meal! I know fresh produce has gone up a bit in price (and they do use quality ingredients), but lunch over $10 for a plate that wasn't exactly loaded with heaping helpings was a surprise. Oh, and if you'd like chopsticks - those are an extra 80 cents or so. I'd recommend just using the silverware. For free.","348119":"Our family has used Vybe several times. Each time they've been quick, the doctors have been knowledgeable and caring, and some rotate from the larger hospitals like CHOP and Penn. We brought our toddler today and the staff was all very accommodating. \n\nThe facility is new, clean, and bright. A plus, they have onsite parking.","349626":"OBSCENE  not essene. The prices are outrageous, especially for produce, and especially when it's not guaranteed to be good all the way through. A $4 bruised pear!!! What?!? I curiously wondered out loud if there's a discount to damaged goods. Nope. And do they happily take back their item after purchase? Not when I tried. \n\nOften times I rummage and see things past their shelf life. Cheese, yogurts... No discount given when I see a yogurt expiring the next day. Go to WholeFoods and you find that same yogurt at $3 cheaper and an expiration of at least 1 month later. \n\nI find expired items all the time. Makes me wonder how much they actually throw away and how many people are turned off by the prices, or else neighbors rich enough not to care, or desperate enough not to make the walk 7 more blocks to Whole Foods. \nWith those 2 factors of wasted product and less shoppers no wonder the price is high.  Forget convenience, seriously drop the prices and maybe you might have more traffic and less expired foods!","355549":"For nearly 40\u00a0years, Essene Market & Cafe has provided the Philadelphia region with a unique venue for everything that's natural, wholesome and healthy. We have the area's largest selection of organically grown produce, a natural foods deli serving mouth watering gourmet delights every day, and an on-site bakery offering tantalizing sweets -- all dairy-free and made without refined sugar.\u00a0(At left:\u00a0Our original store on South Street.)","364024":"Was driving to the city today, on Christmas eve to shop for the night. Called Essene to ask if the meters were free. John, one of the managers was so mean. \"How should I know\" with total nastiness. I told him to be nice please. He said, \"sorry for the mix up\". Called Whole Foods. Asked the same question. She said, \" I'm not sure, want me to google it for you\".  So I called John back at Essene to tell him how nice Whole Foods was and that meters are free on Christmas Eve after 1. In the middle of my sentence he hung up on me. Of course I spent 150$ at Whole foods.","366886":"It's been 5 years since I reviewed Essene Market & Cafe, although I've visited many times since. After a few recent visits I thought it was time to update my review.\n\nThe market itself seems largely unchanged, although they now offer plastic grocery bags at checkout. I appreciate this because I reuse them for my small waste bin. The bags are also biodegradable, which is really nice and rare to find. I never liked the small paper lunch bags they used to use, which I couldn't reuse.\n\nBut the cafe itself has taken a turn for the worse. What used to a vegetarian and nearly all vegan buffet has been replaced by one with fish or egg in nearly every selection. There's a distinct Asian theme; the few things I was able to try seemingly cooked in soy sauce and toasted sesame oil.\n\nWhat I tried was good: warm non-fried spicy tofu - better than the previous fried cold stuff - and assorted warmed veggies. But by the time I sat down, everything was lukewarm at best. Even the soup which I expected to be piping hot was barely warm. A bummer on this cold Friday evening.\n\nSpeaking of, it was dinner time on a Friday (7ish) and there was only one other table occupied in the cafe, who shortly thereafter left, leaving only me.\n\nOn the plus side, the price-per-pound seems to have gone down ($7.99\/lb), the cashier Kiera was really nice, and frankly, I did appreciate the peace and quiet while eating and reading.\n\nI'd still recommend supporting Essene Market & Cafe over the madness that is Whole Foods Market & Cafe, but if you're vegetarian or vegan like me, just remember to read the signs at the hot bar because most say \"contains fish\" or \"contains egg\" (or both.) Perhaps the more they see that the veg stuff is selling over the non-veg stuff, they will revisit the menu.","368252":"I went in last night for a raging, painful ear infection. The facility is really pretty and really clean. It feels like you're checking into a hotel instead of urgent care. The check in people were nice and the place was empty. I was in and out within an hour. The doctor was thoughtful and understanding. She sent my rx to the pharmacy for immediate pickup and I was able to have this awful thing treated and feeling better right away. Nice place.","369405":"Allergy folks beware!\n\n  I used to shop at Essene often due to my gluten allergy. While shopping this past weekend I was offered a free sample of a gluten free cookie, from a table advertising a variety of gluten free cookies.  I took and ate one, after which I went to ask the sales person where I could buy some.  It turns out that the cookie was NOT gluten free and was confined to my house for the rest of the day due to my allergic reaction.\n\nI would have been mollified if I had received any sort of appropriate response\/apology from the company.  I alerted the manager who just acknowledged my complaint and walked away, and received NO response from alerting the company online via their online contact form.  I was appalled at the ineptitude of the staff to handle this issue and strongly caution anyone with an allergy against shopping there.  In my personal experience my allergy was not taken seriously and my complaints were ignored.","371349":"After not coming in here for almost a decade I decided to pop in again because I recently moved only one block away. Everything I said in my review 10 years ago is still exactly the same except the prices are even higher and the selection is even worse. I honestly don't understand who shops here and what they are buying. I walked out with a Blondie today and I got it home and it had the consistency of cornbread and absolutely no flavor. It's not even worth it to pop in here just for a quick bottled beverage or snack.","373329":"Slightly better now with the new owners.  The lady at the register with the green\/blue hair is the only polite one who works there. Everyone else needs to be trained\/taught how to deal with the public. The health and beauty department is always about 90 degrees fahrenheit and I doubt that helps keep the products from spoiling\/melting.\n\nThe last time I ate there, I was eating, when I suddenly heard the sound of nails being clipped. I looked over, and yep, the lady working at the cafe was standing right by the food trays, clipping her nails. When I told the owner bout it, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away to go back to stocking shelves. \n\nThe cafe serves up flavorless slop and I cannot believe I gave it the benefit of the doubt on three occasions. I could not even eat most of it. (you are better off eating at Soy Cafe) The prepared food in the refrigerated section is okay, a hit or miss. I keep asking them where they moved their 'Awesome foods' brand items and they keep pointing at other foods that are clearly not the same brand. I tried the other brands and they are not as good as the Awesome Foods brand. I guess they no longer carry them. \n\nThe juice bar attendants act as though I am torturing them when I place an order. No worries, there are LOTS of other juice bars in Philly, yes, even in my neighborhood (fish town)\n\nOverall, their prices on most items are too high and I suspect that their employees are paid a low wage. I often see products on the shelves that are about to expire the next day and there is no discount on them. All of this is a recipe for going out of business.\nI still go there to buy certain items, but do most of my shopping elsewhere.\n\nPenn Herb Company is MUCH better, so is Whole Foods and several others.","377691":"Thank you to the staff at Vybe for your amazing bedside manner and competence. The new clinic is immaculate with state of the art equipment and the end to end experience was seamless allowing me to get what I needed quickly and professionally. I will definitely be recommending the clinic to all in the future.","380133":"Don't waste your time. They are obviously in business only for the money. When I went in, I was told that they could only address one issue per visit. That should have been my sign and I wish I had left at that time. I was misdiagnosed and ended up going to one of the hospital affiliated urgent care clinics a few days later with a completely different result. Vybe is a beautiful environment, but it is just fluff. Through the years I have been to many urgent care clinics and this place was my worst experience.","381051":"Essene has most likely suffered a bit from having a Whole Foods within a six block vincinity.  It's hard for the little guys to compete with the prices a national chain with its own products can offer.  Their produce is a wee bit overpriced and there isn't a whole lot to choose from.  But they do have some things that Whole Foods don't, particularly odd root vegetables that are key to macrobiotic cooking.  Their pastries are really good and seemingly healthier than the oil-filled ones at Whole Foods.\n\nThey also have an eat-in food bar which has more selection and many more veggie\/vegan options than Whole Foods.  It's also more comfy.  What saddens me is that they haven't had Virgil's Root Beer there for a couple months.  That stuff is SO GOOD. They do, however, have these delicious soy dream 'ice cream' bars and little pies that I treat myself to once in a blue moon. All in all, I''d probably rather spend my hard earned cash at Essene, but I'd walk away with significantly fewer groceries.  Isn't that how it goes in this age of corporate globalization?","383070":"Okay, I go to Essene enough, I guess I can say I really like it.  Everyone who works there is always so darn friendly and helpful as well.  Heeeey Juuude.\n\nBut their soup, ohh their soups.  How I LOOVE their soups.","383260":"Every time I go into essene I see the same man working, and he has such positive energy just pouring out of him. He is helpful but not at all overbearing, which is important. I've gone in a few times for food items but he's usually working the pharmacy section. I went in today for CBD products and he was so extremely helpful, I couldn't decide what product to get if any. He guided me to purchase the right product for my needs (he's so knowledgeable about everything there!!!) and even gave me a free sample. I left with a ton of suggestions for anxiety remedies to use alongside CBD as well. To say the least this employee at essene is the best!! And he is just a person you want to be around!!","384845":"I just went to cook my sweet brown rice for a meal today. When I filled up my pot to wash the rice what did I see? Worms\/larvae floating to the top. Not just one or two either but many. I've shopped at the store for over ten years. How disappointing I am and quite angry initially. I feed my 5 year old daughters this food. I tried to give excuses why I see food that should be refrigerated sitting off to the side in an aisles as a shop. They must be busy and it's going to be taken care of soon right? This place is becoming more disgusting by the week. Don't even get me started with the prepared food which I did give a fair chance. Please be careful in this place and don't take anything for granted. The new owners are obviously not informed about regulations and codes.","386898":"I like the emt and pa that help me , but they took too long and the office was empty. The receptionist was kind short with me and sent my prescription to the wrong pharmacy. I won't suggest for anyone to use this service and they keep a credit card on file, what the what is that all about. Great concept but fell short on my expectations. It a real shame place like this would do well in this location, hopefully Vybe can send some managers to streamline this process, I should have gone to the emergency room it would have been quicker.","387659":"I love it here. There is something special and authentic about independent health food stores like this. I also love the selection of macrobiotic, high-quality traditional Japanese food and teas. I always leave here inspired.\nThe baked goods are amazing. Too good. I'm glad I don't live near the store - I would eat them all the time : )\nThe one negative comment I do want to add is the bulk section needs work. The seem to get infested by flys \/ larva often. This happens - I worked in a small heath food store as a teen. To keep this from happening requires constant maintenance and a cool store temperature, but it can be done.\nIn all, this is one of my favorite health food stores and stands as a reminder of where the natural foods movement started.","397916":"Could be so much better than it actually is. If not Whole Foods at 9th & South this is your best bet for organic produce and non-mainstream foods in the area, but the prices are insanely high... How the oft-under-employed hipsters who frequent the place afford it is beyond me...","398648":"Nice private store, as opposed to Whole Foods etc. They have some local things that you can't find at the box places. Although the prices are still a bit high but manageable,except for maybe the $7+ for  a quart of ice cream...","401408":"Given the choice, I'll take a cheeseburger and fries over seitan and soy any day, but despite this fact, I have a soft spot for health food stores. Maybe because it reminds me of my days as a vegetarian, Grateful Dead-loving, pachouli-wearing hippie. Perhaps it gives me hope that I can change my ways and learn to love the greens again. Or maybe I just inhaled one too many times. Whatever the reason, and ignoring the fact that I don't cook (thank you for feeding me, husband), I can still be convinced to pay $5 for a bag of natural cookies or $4 for a bottle of juice because they're healthy. \n\nI echo the sentiments of the other reviewers that it's expensive to shop here, and I particularly like Nate F's thoughts on socioeconomics and the availability of natural food. I go out of my way to support small businesses and applaud Essene's presence in the neighborhood. But what's with the crazy selection of bottled water? Seriously, there were like 20 different types to choose from. Not exactly the most environmentally friendly products to stock up on (unless there is a zombie epidemic - then that Poland Spring I bought two years ago will really come in handy). And the staff needs to lighten up a bit - it won't kill you guys to crack a smile. I promise it won't hurt your hardcore healthy street cred to be friendlier. Maybe they just need a hug (or a nice, juicy steak)?","401739":"Essene recently made-over their fruits and veggie section, and it's better than ever.  I like that they continue to bring in interesting, luscious fruits and veggies (now I know where to buy taro root besides Iovine's), and that it's good stuff.\n\nI also love visiting their drink section.  They are always bringing in new weird delicious stuff - still loving the Zukay drinks and raw dressings.\n\nHappy to see they're cleaning the place up, and it's more sparkling and organized than ever.","404294":"I am literally writing this right after coming out of Essene. I've been shopping there for about 6 months and EVERY time i have an issue with getting juice there. Well today was the final straw. I always get beet and celery juice but today i wasn't allowed to because \"we don't do that\". What? yes you do, you always do. Every time I go i've been charged differently but i just let that go. this was just enough. I already over pay for this and i would have paid more to get what i wanted, but \"they don't do that\". you lost a customer for good all because of a stupid juice and a rude employee. thank goodness the new juice place on 9th and south is really good.","408344":"Oh, hell no.\n\nFor years, I have loved Essene's old-skool hippie veg buffet. I loved their millet cakes (seriously, I would walk out of my way to eat freakin millet) and the seitan and hearty steamed kale. I loved the wholesome but still sweet hippie spelt cakes. Everything was vegan. Then dairy crept in but it was clearly marked and not in most dishes. \n\nI hadn't been to Essene in a few years due to my living in West Philly and now Mount Airy. When in South Philly, I usually hit up Blackbird or Grindcore House. But today I wanted to check out an old fave.\n\nI saw the recent bad Yelp reviews about the new chef and fish and still went. I am admittedly writing this review without having eaten a bite, a first. But I couldn't eat anything, not even veggies, because 95% of the dishes had fish sauce in them (it was, at least, clearly marked). Even dishes that would not be enhanced by fish sauce and were otherwise vegan just randomly had it. I thought the reviews about fish meant they were serving actual fish flesh and going paleo (ugh) but it's just gluten and soy with fish sauce. Really wtf???? \n\nJust as baffling and sad, the buffet itself was pretty bare, with old looking food sitting around in nearly empty pans. And I was just there at the height of dinner time.\n\nI put down my kombucha and spelt muffin and walked out. It's very sad that such a unique spot has settled for a confusing, uninspired and, more importantly, unethical menu.\n\nEssene management: please listen to these Yelp reviews and once loyal customers. Updating your menu is fine. Things change. But this is just pitiful.","410229":"Essene is a great place to shop, especially compared to the crowded and overpriced Whole Foods around the corner. I mainly come here to buy Yogi tea. They have every flavor imaginable and the tea is a tad cheaper than other stores around. I've also gotten good produce here and a lot of my cooking\/snacking essentials. I like to give food (like dried fruit and unique snacks) as gifts - yes, I know I'm a little strange - to friends and family, and Essene always has the perfect item for this. They also carry PiperWai deodorant (from Shark Tank!!), which is hard to find in Philly.\n\nI have yet to try the cafe food in the back dining area, but it always looks and smells amazing - will have to try it out in the near future!\n\nIt's fun just walking around the store, even if you don't end up purchasing anything.","417906":"I was so glad I found this place when I was walking around South street because there wasn't anything close to what I can eat around there. I was looking for something healthy and vegetarian and magically after walking around and admiring the shops and bars I found Essene. I was so famished that I first went to their buffet. Everything was vegan. I got seitan beef and veggies. I also got a green smoothie. My cheeks were full of delish-ness goodness! I bought a few items before I left. They had a great selection of natural and organic products that I was used to seeing back home.","423697":"Very clean and quiet facility with super helpful staff. The nurse at the front desk made me aware of a promotion they were having and applied the discount for me, which saved me about $25. Although my physical was not as thorough as it would be at a regular primary care physician's office, the place was empty and I got in right away. No major complaints.","429070":"Good in a pinch. They have some cool local finds like local butter and keifer. More vegan centered than grocery centered. On the whole though, it's over priced.","431265":"I've been to vybe 3 times, once for an abscess on finger draining, once for spained ankle and once for an abscess again. (None of these for me personally but for the person I was with) the staff is always great, the facility is alwaYs clean, service is quick and efficient.","456560":"The market is relatively small and poorly stocked, in my opinion.  What is good about this place is that they have free cooking\/health\/lifestyle classes.  Christine Pirello taught a particularly interesting one awhile back on sclerology and eating to nourish the skin.","461592":"Fast care and kind providers but with some problems. The doctor forgot my only important script when calling them in, then electronically filed rather than calling, leaving me stressed and waiting at the pharmacy for nearly an hour with the flu - not ideal.","461914":"I was a mother with a baby vomiting and having diarrhea.  I wanted to make him chicken soup, my office is on 4th so the word \"Market\" caught my eye driving home to him. Went in and stopped one of the staff and asked where their poultry section was.  He sarcastically took his time to tell me they did not have a poultry section, ( mean while my 15 month old is getting more dehydrated by the second)!\nWhat is with the rude sarcastic attitude!  No where are there any large signs stating vegetarian!  A simple no would have  sufficed!\nDear Staff person,\nThank you for reminding me that kindness and consideration is a rarity in this city and that the next time someone is exceptionally kind and caring I will validate them and encourage them to keep spreading that love.  I hope you all the best and hope that you gain meaning and peace in your life.","462164":"Went to get physicals today for my girls going to school, arrived at 10:30am and our old pediatrician had not faxed over the records yet so the doctor refused to do the physicals, even though I told the lovely receptionist we were fine not to have them signed until the immunization records came in. Went back when immunizations came in, but there was a problem with the records and only one of my kids could get the physical done. After waiting another 30 minutes we learned the clinic had no way to test ears. I called the school and asked if it was ok to skip that, school receptionist said that the school nurse could do it, it wouldn't be a problem. I told the clinic that and waited another 45 minutes before heading out of our room to ask the doctor why we hadn't been seen. She then told me the school would need to send that in writing. After being at Vybe \"Urgent\" care almost 2 hours-we did not get a SCHOOL physical for either of my kids (let's be real this is just to get into School on a form the school provides). Receptionist was at least apologetic and refunded us the money - she was helpful, the female doctor could have cared less!","464347":"I came in with stomach issues that had been on and off for a few weeks. Told them I thought it was a parasite and that I'd recently been to Mexico. They said it probably wasn't, then told me they didn't know what was wrong with me. I kept feeling horrible and throwing up after I left. Finally I went to another urgent care center who confirmed that it was giardiasis (a parasite that i picked up in Mexico). \nI cannot believe how lazy and incompetent Vybe is. I even told them what I thought it was and they just ignored me. They said it wasn't possibly a parasite (clearly with 0 knowledge about how a parasite acts in the system). \nVybe was a waste of money and I could have started getting better a lot earlier.","471919":"this is a really good independent health food store. it may be the only one in the city anymore. i've been coming here for years. they have a more limited selection than say whole foods, but by far many more niche items. it's not all vegetarian and vegan. they have free-range and organic meats and fish in the freezer. \n\nthe hot\/salad bar in the cafe is all vegetarian and almost completely vegan (very rarely they will have clearly labeled items with egg like quiche.) it's maybe a little better than the buffet at whole foods, but not much. $8.99\/lb. and everything's heavy. last time i was here the dude in front of me got rang up for $20 and it really didn't look like he had a lot of food on his plate at all. so be careful.\n\nlastly someone mentioned being shocked at buying a produce item here that was $13. don't be shocked. i used to work at a health food store in willow grove and we got produce in once a week and it moved slowly. we ended up throwing out a ton. plus, it was all organic, so it was more expensive to procure. so don't buy your produce here, unless you work here and it's that convenient for you. you're better off at the italian market a few blocks away or whole foods if you want organic.","482279":"I respect this place for being one of very few places that offer unpasteurized milk, but they have little respect for posted hours and feel free to close whenever they feel like. I just had an unpleasant experience of running into a locked door 10 minutes before posted close time and no posted explanation whatsoever. Nobody cared. I'm curious if this is the new ownership that feels its ok.","488632":"I kinda get the vibe that that half assed hippies who work here think they're better than everybody else.  Just so we're clear, you're not.  And it's going to be funny once your college money runs out and you have to do something more legitimate than overcharge people for groceries for a living.\n\nSeriously, there's not one thing in this place fairly priced.  Is your entire marketing strategy \"hey, at least we're not whole foods\"?\n\nGo fuck yourselves.","491462":"Come for the expired products, stay for how they illegally save parking spots. How this place stays in business is a mystery.","492921":"What once was a glorious  all Vegan food bar now has signs, \" may contain, fish, wheat, or dairy.\" Nope, nope, nope.","493420":"I give Essene 3 stars because I'm reluctant to give four so quickly. I like their spot. The produce seems to be better than whole foods; at least you get a better product even though both spots are expensive. I like their large variety of teas; coffee is good, too. The people who work there seem to be friendly for the most part. So maybe after a few more trips, I'll bump 'em up to four from three.","497020":"I came in here this weekend and spent $66 on a bag of snack food (mostly). Now, hear me out.\n\nI have food issues. Major ones. I follow a special diet for health reasons and it requires me to avoid foods that contain high amounts of fermentable sugars. This includes almost everything in the world that's delicious including wheat, dairy, most fruits and veggies even garlic and onion, beans, mushrooms, and all manner of other wonderful things. Finding snack food that does not contain any of these things is... challenging to say the least, infuriating at times even.\n\nAfter a very disappointing stop at the new gluten-free baker (all their stuff has honey, which I can't have, and it turns out their primary flour is also verboten to me), I came here with the intent to purchase any and every snacky item that I could have and try them all to see what's worth coming back for. This took me forever because I read every single label twice before anything goes in my cart and their selection is just that fantastic.\n\nAlmond milk pudding cups!!! Numerous kinds of rice chips, several types of granola bars, GF pecan pie, the list goes on and on. I bought a few responsible things like puffed millet and rice syrup with which to make some rice crispie treat type things, and some interesting looking kelp noodles to try, and some GF frozen items like pizza crusts. \n\nWords cannot describe my happiness. So far everything has been delicious, from the raw vegan mint chocolate tart (SO GOOD), to the pecan pie, to the pudding cups. OMG those pudding cups are out of control. Oh, the vegan chedder-style cheese I tried wasn't great, I like Daiya or Rice Dream much better.\n\nSure, it's a bit pricey. I wouldn't come here for anything but my special-needs food items, but if you are one of those people who needs nutritious alternatives to typical foods, this is your place.","500264":"There is absolutely no reason to shop here. Every single item is grossly overpriced. If you're one of those people (like me) for whom Whole Foods or Trader Joe's is a luxury you budget for because you can't live without, you will laugh your way out the door at this place.\n\nI've walked past numerous times and today I decided to finally go in. It's a beautiful store! As I walked through, I was utterly agog at their audacity in pricing. You know how sometimes you'll be in a drugstore and see something - say, a pizza - that's priced at $8.99?...and you think to yourself \"What?! They have that at ACME for $5.99!\" That sums up Essene in a nutshell.\n\nI cannot stress enough the lack of exaggeration in my review. There is absolutely, positively nothing in this store worth paying their asking price for. Also, the description here on Yelp that this place has a 'hipster vibe' is an understatement. If the tattooed 20-something staff exuded any more aloofness you could spread it on a whole grain organic cracker.\n\nThis place makes me miss the chef's market that used to be open to the public on South Street. I used to get bundles of organic parsley there for 59 cents each. At Essene they're $1.99. I think that says it all.","515189":"It's great to support the little guy sometimes, and this is the perfect place to do it in. This is a natural foods market that offers a Lot of the same things whole foods does - only it has a better hot\/salad bar, vitamin section, lunch selection, and tea aisle. A lot of the things can be a little more expensive, but you can also score some good buys.Just don't go here if your looking for meat and seafood because it's a total vegetarian selection. But you won't be able to top things like their New York \"Beef\" sandwich, even if it is seitan. They do have some cheeses, but only kinds that don't have certain animal enzymes - so you find Parmesan Reggiano and some other staples.","519733":"I've been to Vybe South Philly twice--once for an eye injury, and once for a somewhat embarrassing thing that I'd rather not discuss on a public forum lol. Both times I've been able to book an appointment easily online, waited less than 10 minutes after arriving, and been seen by a friendly, competent doctor (Dr. Mortillaro and Dr. Oswald were both great). I'm a medical student myself, and this is the kind of care that I hope to provide for my patients someday. Highly recommended!","526295":"after 20+ years shopping at this place, i've been incredibly offended and disappointed the last six years. after it was sold the first time, customer service and food selections began to disintegrate. when it was sold this last time, there became suspicion, rudeness and very poor customer service and choices. it kind of became more of a hot food takeout from a food court. i was there this evening about 7:30 to buy nutritional yeast and tofu, and the young lady at the register was just horrible and nasty. i'm not allowed to say why without this review being removed, but needless to say, she and the woman i dealt with at least a year before at the very same register, had an issue with my hair and complexion. shame on you, essene, for allowing this kind of behavior and expecting it to pass as normal.","535231":"The last several times my husband and I frequented this market, we left feeling \"short changed\" and saying \"maybe they just had a bad day....\"\nThis past encounter left us with a different feeling....  \nWe entered the check out line with one couple in front of us.  I noticed it was the same young man behind the counter we've seen previously.  As the couple swiped their depit card, i saw that the young man make a comically large eye roll. I figured \" oh these people come here all the time and they are high maintenance, etc.\" Now it was our turn...\nWhen he said \"credit or debit\" and my husband said \"credit\",  I watched as the young man brought his finger up to his temple and mockingly \"shot himself in the head\" in front of the line at the register that was slowly growing.\nI couldn't believe what i saw.  It was 45 minutes before they closed, so nobody was keeping him there. i couldn't believe the disrespect as we felt leaving this establishment.  We try as hard as we can to support local businesses, even with the escalated price. But, we know how important it is.  We also know how important it is to have a job. Many would be beyond grateful to have his position at this boutique market and his behavior was inexcusable.  \nI can't speak for everyone that works there...but we would suggest making a personnel change.","540438":"The iPad checkin is convenient. The rest of the process was not good. It was as if they wanted an argument. The nurse, without understanding my situation, decided I didn't need to see a doctor. Very disappointing.","541228":"I guess they deleted my first review. Months ago I came in, long story short when I left they gave me a bill with a print out of the symptoms I told them I had. This place is a scam. Right now I am sitting in the hospital after having my appendix removed, they didn't believe me. Nor did they do any tests.","543435":"Getting an Essene Mexican chocolate cake for my kids' birthdays has been a tradition for years.  We picked up the cake from the bakery on Tuesday.  It was a little lopsided, but we were happy to overlook that.  When we cut into it at the party, though, it had air pockets in the cake, and deep pits of icing where either the cake had fallen or had been damaged.  The icing was literally filling holes so that the cake looked normal.  A baker with any expertise or professionalism wouldn't have let that cake go out of the store. I miss the old Essene that held high standards of quality.","544287":"These people are just awesome. They are efficient  and kind and empathetic. Incredibly good place to go when you don't feel so great","551282":"I am so thankful I found this urgent care while I was on vacation in Philadelphia! I went it for symptoms of a UTI and if you have ever had one, they are miserable! I went and didn't have to wait long, facility was extremely clean and the doctor Neha Mody was so nice, I told her I was on vacation and she offered little tips and places to visit while I was there. The nurses and front staff were friendly as well and I told them I wish we had friendly people at urgent cares in California.","553576":"This review is for COVID-19 testing only.  We visited the day before Thanksgiving after a potential exposure.  Most places required doctor's referrals or had appointment times weeks out, but Vybe had one 6:40 PM slot available for a \"telemedicine\" appointment and we took it.  The nurse called at 6:40 PM sharp, helped us through the standard registration and pre-appointment procedures, and in less than ten minutes, we were on and off the phone with a doctor who prescribed us the test and instructed us to get to Vybe as soon as we could before they stopped doing swab tests at 7:15.  A short five minute drive and an even shorter 2-3 minute test and we were out the door.  Testing was done through Quest, so it did take a while for results (7 days), but our experience overall with Vybe was smooth and efficient. Staff is very friendly, as well.  Would highly recommend.","560812":"Stopped in yesterday for a few quick groceries and food from the hot bar. Pleasantly surprised this neighborhood gem exists. Walking in, it has the feel of a corner market with your standard fruits\/veggies\/cheeses\/meats, onto the regular grocery items, and then after some investigating there is a very large section for vitamins and supplements, lots of pre-prepared meals, a hot food buffet (all vegan\/vegetarian food), and a juice bar! 10\/10 would go back!","562678":"I have been trying very hard to live healthily, ecologically, sustainably, and all that other good, earthy stuff. But I definitely tow the line - I still can't resist a shiny, chemically-treated apple or pass up an economy-sized package of toilet paper. So the market part of Essene is not really for me, I'm much more of a Whole Foods girl. But the WF salad bar has truly been disappointing me - it sort of reminds me of day camp when they used to mix up all the leftovers with some vinegar and call it pasta salad. So as a non-vegetarian it is a huge compliment for me to say that the food bar at Essene rocks my world. I wouldn't know seitan from tempeh, but truthfully, the way they deliciously doctor it up I wouldn't know it from beef either. I pretty much licked clean a plate of veggies and tofu and the only thing I had beef with was the price. But apparently such is the status quo of healthy living these days...hopefully the eco-movement and an economy push will make places like Essene more accessable. Until then, my trips to the hot bar will be a cherished treat.","563716":"These people aren't qualified to butter corn at the county fair.  I thought this would be less awful than going to the ER. I was wrong.  \n\nI went in with a cluster headache (a rare and absurdly painful condition.  It's been 16 days.  Google it ).  These can be aborted by oxygen in a specific concentration (12-40 liters per minute for 20 minutes).  After pretending that the laughably incompetent staff were 'medical professionals' - the person who took my vitals didn't know what prednisone was, and it took three adults to figure out how to turn on the O2 tank... the snotty PA told me she'd \"worked in a neurologist's office\" (doing what?  Cleaning the place at night?).\n\nI'd also like to point out that I was requesting OXYGEN.  Not narcotics.  Or anything even remotely objectionable.\n\nWhen I finally got the O2 approved (and three staff came to figure out how to turn it on) I was TOLD the rate was 12 liters per minute (lpm) - the minimum concentration effective.  It turns out it was 8 lpm.  Which no studies indicate is effective.\n\nI called ahead to ask if it was possible to get abortive O2 for this at this location.  I was put on hold and everything, and I was told yes.\n\nSo:  idiots, incompetent- also condescending, especially since they were not versed in my condition-  AND THEY LIED TO ME ABOUT THE \"CARE\" I was given.  Really??!?  \n\nAvoid.","567569":"Wow, what a find!!  I have been coming to the area for decades for Jim's Cheesesteaks and now I have another reason to come here.  \n\nYou wouldn't expect such a healthy alternative considering the food choices around South St.  There is a hot and cold food bar all the way in the back which is packed with absolutely exceptional food.  \n\nA combination of soul food and Korean, all vegan and\/or vegetarian.  Homemade Kim chi, Scallion pancakes, eggrolls and a turmeric roasted cauliflower to die for\u203c A wide variety of healthy food made fresh daily.\n\nThe staff also was very attentive, knowledgeable and available to explain the preparation of each dish.  This was particularly true of the gentleman who runs the kitchen named Maynard\n\nI'm looking forward to returning with my family soon for the perfect combination of healthy and delicious.","568788":"Don't waste your time going to this urgent care. I would describe the staff as rude and incompetent. It's the rudeness that bothers me more than the incompetence. A few months ago I went bc I thought I had strep. Their tests didn't detect it. Went to my dr the next day bc I was in so much pain and of course I had it. Took my daughter there last week and same thing. They also said they would call back with culture results and never did. Glad I followed up with pediatrician. This is the worst urgent care and I'm never going back there. If you're a doctor who can't get a job bc of your incompetence, apply to work at Vybe","581023":"This place has saved me for 3 years running when I have been on the Daniel fast (no meats, no sweets, no dairy) with a fairly well stocked and delicious options that made fasting much easier (and more tasty). \n\nIf you are coming to shop here be prepared to spend some money as this store is not cheap by any means. However if organic, locally grown, natural products are your thing and you are in queen village, this is the place for you.\n\nPROS:\n- helpful, friendly, knowledgable staff\n- really good prepared food section\n- cafe section in the back of the market is ALWAYS clean\n- the desserts are incredible\n- an amazing organic health and beauty department\n\nCONS:\n- on the expensive side for basic things (juice, milk, etc)\n- have experienced the occasional purchase of items that were either spoiled or past the expiration dates\n- for an organic, locally grown, etc specialty store, they don't carry a few more popular organic brands\n\nTIPS:\n-come prepared to spend money as Essene rarely has sales and natural foods and products can be very pricy.\n-Make sure you read every label for expiration. My boss and I have both experienced bringing something home from Essene that was past the expiration date. No bueno.","581112":"I should preface this by saying that I'm a full-time omnivore but, like Dan F. below, enjoy dipping my toes into the vegetarian\/vegan\/macrobio waters now and then to detox from the less-than-optimal at-work lunches and intermittent take-out dinners.\n\nLast night was my first time in Essene. Parking was a bitch; I have a full-sized sedan and yes, I can park it like a pro, but with a Septa bus up my ass and cars parked on both sides of a ridiculously narrow road.. well. Let's say I was hoping for good things to come to make up for it.\n\nFirst impression, hey, this place is bigger than I expected. Nice. The GF was hungry enough to threaten gnawing my arm off and sucking the marrow out of the stump, so we headed for the cafe first. We loaded up a bunch of different things: some sort of quinoa\/braised cabbage cold salad (SO good), a spicy cole slaw, breaded seitan and tofu in Italian seasoning, Bombay veggie curry, grilled veg. Everything was good: not mind-blowingly excellent, but homey, well-seasoned, and cooked right. It was comfort food.\n\nNext time I'm totally trying their raw juices. Carrot? Apple? Beet? oh yes.\n\nI was pleased with their selection of goods, especially the tons of raw foods (raw PB macaroons, holy gods, so good--we're trying the raw apple granola tonight). I'm going to splurge for the raw olive oil next trip (it's in the refrigerated section by the bulk bins, not with the other oils). I was psyched to see that they have ZenSoy products: it's the soy milk for people who hate soy milk (try the vanilla) and their chocolate pudding is utterly awesome, tastes like \"real\" Jell-O pudding (oh the irony of that statement) without any aftertastes that tend to plague some natural product attempts at copying the crap brands.\n\nProduce was underwhelming: there were definitely some things there that couldn't have been local (bananas etc) so I can't let 'em have that excuse, but we didn't try much because it's farmer's market peak season. I got some gorgeous golden beets and a lovely kabocha squash.\n\nThis place got the GF psyched about trying healthier (lower GI for us) goodies: that alone is amazing (she's usually leery of soy-anything but actually asked me to buy seitan for her--sadly since it's wheat gluten it sort of slays the whole GI advantage but she discovered a new meat alternative to enjoy).\n\nWe bought a bunch of vegan desserts from their bakery, but eh. The raspberry oat bar was ok, but had some sort of strange flax-y undertone (like, stale flax-y, not good flax-y). The vegan raspberry cream pie was a disaster: would have been amazing as JUST raspberry but the soy pudding they made was horrid. The large raspberry thumbprint cookie was ok; it was our favorite out of their case, but fell apart the second we tried to nom it. It still wasn't excellent (unlike those vegan PB macaroons from a packet omggggg).\n\nI bought some nice-looking French lentils at the bulk counter, they look like they'll need extensive picking-through for \"bits\" but hopefully they'll taste as awesome as they look.\n\nThe supplement\/beauty section is amazingly stocked. I'll be spending more time in there the next time I need refills of vitamins and herbs.\n\nThey also have a tiny but nice housewares section, including rice cookers, yogurt makers (well, A yogurt maker), Japanese donabe pots (I want one), glass versions of Tupperware (pricey, but YES for less plastic). I had to come home with a suribachi\/surigoku. I've wanted one for years but was unwilling to pay for shipping from Japan for a small one: here I got a nice, 9\" suribachi for $15. Win.\n\nI'd give this place 3.5 stars because of the underwhelming produce, but since we can't do that here, they get bumped up for the variety of stuff I'll be excited to try. All in all, we'll be back. Can't wait to try more of the stuff we bought, too.","587129":"WHY?  WHY HAVE I NOT BEEN GOING HERE?!\n\nI stopped in Essene after a walk through Fabric Row and then proceeded to kick myself for not coming in sooner.  I was stunned by the sheer size of this place.  They have their mini cafe in the back, plus a great assortment of fruits, veggies, nuts, grains...even pet food and a hair care\/beauty aisle.  I know it's kind of pricey, but I'm officially in love with this place.","589909":"Essene has needed investment and reinvention for many years. It could be a fantastic market with a street side cafe, coffee bar, and outdoor seating. The market was sold a few years back and I hoped the new owners would breathe new life into the place. Not much changed, but at least the quality of the food on the cold\/hot bar was maintained. Now the market is again under new ownership and the plan in place is obvious: Soy Sauce Seasoned Asian Food Bar. There used to be a variety of vegetarian options - Asian, Indian, vegetable lasagna, yummy casseroles and seitan stews. I may be glorifying it a bit, but I don't remember walking away disappointed. What did I find today? Fried food, rubbery looking fried eggs, soggy vegetables, and hardly anything raw. There wasn't even a lettuce or leafy green to be found. The kimchi was so salty that it was inedible for me.\n\nIt's really unfortunate.  An owner with vision could make Essene amazing...","605222":"I wish I could give this place less than one star. I came here excited that a juice bar was so close to my work! I ordered the solar flare juice and asked for Apple instead of carrot. immediately I was told I had to pay $1 extra to swap apple for carrot which made no sense to me whatsoever but I complied without complaining. Once I got my drink I was extremely dissatisfied with it. all I could taste was ginger. I asked if it was possible it could get re made with less and I was given a ridiculous amount of attitude. the 2 girls working made me feel like a burden and not a customer. I will never come back here","610534":"Very expensive. This place is also understaffed and poorly managed. Came in and only one young girl working in register with super long line!   While the other guy just staring and on his phone with his airpods in. Crazy!!","617931":"99% certain they are not taking the tare off before charging you for cafe food. there is NO WAY the salad i just got was 2 1\/2 pounds, but the stoner behind the counter insisted it's built in. BE CAREFUL and don't get ripped off.\n\nalso, this place is seriously overdue for a visit from the health inspector. fly traps in the cafe, really? have a look under the utensils dispenser next time you're here.\n\nonly gets two stars for the same reason comcast does: some things they offer you can only get \nhere, like weird vegan ingredients.","618833":"I find all my macro stuff here. This is perfect for me because this is how I eat and live. They have perfect items that I live by not just food it's my go to place. It's amazing because I already know what everything is and it's kinda my thing for the past 2 decades. Not everything is healthy in here, but that's like all places. Balance your life and body and eat things that bring you closer to the elements of the earth. It actually makes you understand life better and how things work which open up other things.","622436":"Essene serves a very specific purpose, which is to be the place that a Whole Foods hater should go to shop when there isn't a farmers market up and running.  Make that a dual purpose, the other purpose being a place to go if you are so anal about eating organic food that EVERYTHING has to be organic for you.\n\nThe selection of products is good however it's too expensive to justify getting much there.  Red lentils for 4.50 a pound...Jesus Christ.  Yes they're organic, but that's still very high for humble lentils.  I got some things for hummus when I was there--luckily they did have one brand of non-organic tahini so I didn't have to spend a fortune on that.  Among the items I purchased was a pack of lavash bread.  All seemed to be going well with the bread but after just a few days out on the counter it became moldy.  Boo.  \n\nAs is the case with many of these small, specialty markets I say this: \"You do good work.  Best of luck to you.\"  Unfortunately I won't be doing a lot of shopping here.","632090":"If i could give zero stars I would .  The doctor was fine; prescribed me lidocaine for throat pain.  Every CVS in the area seemed to be out of it.  Called back and spoke to some un named person who told me to buy it over the counter.  Said to go home and google it.  Despite the fact that i'm in more pain than i have been in a decade, I started to look around.  Called some pharmacies and was told that under no circumstances is this medicine ever sold over the counter.  She had all of the bedside manner of a person who couldn't get any other job.","639988":"Two stars because it's incredibly expensive and they sell expired items. Make sure you're checking the dates before you buy!","643092":"This place has lots of things not available elsewhere , although they have stopped carrying some items that surprise me.  Chicory is one example.","648458":"I know people complain that this place is short staffed and the front desk person is actually the same person taking your blood- BUT they work really hard and are all so very friendly. Each time I have gone here for lab work, the staff is so effective and efficient. I'm a scaredy cat with needles and blood and they always make me feel so much better, chatting with me to help distract me and smiling, even through a mask. I think this is such a reliable spot !","652901":"This is the closest 'walkable' grocery store in the queens village area, which has many produce options. Simply put: Essene is pricey. Before you know it, those two onions, 4 tomatoes and carton of eggs you grabbed-ends up costing you $20. The upside? Things are fresh, plentiful, look actually organic, and well organized. You feel like you're in a baby private-sector of Whole Foods. Most shelf items are organic\/vegan brand names. You won't find things like dawn soap but will find brands similar to 7th Gen. There's a hot bar, which I have yet to try; so I can't comment on that. I like it here. Just not realistic and not all the time. Fyi: 2nd and South St will be opening an Heirloom Giant grocery store in the next 6 months or so. Much needed for this area.","654195":"Cynthia at the front desk is all about giving the customer a hard time. Maybe she was bullied in middle school or isn't getting enough love at home? Who knows? It doesn't have to be this difficult Cynthia.\nI went to lock my bike & was put at the back of the line. And couldn't check in my sick girlfriend, they made her walk thru the heat to do it herself. Wonderful service!","658640":"I have never had a problem here. The staff has always been nice to me. They make me feel at ease when taking my blood. I am usually in and out. I don't have to wait too long. I would recommend making an appointment to avoid waiting. The phlebotomists are pretty good with my small veins.","666594":"I'm no vegan. I'm just an everyday carnivore. But I do appreciate natural beauty products and a variety of healthy food options. The personal care and vitamin selection is fantastic. Haven't bought groceries yet but I'll be back for snacks and assorted natural goodies.","667662":"Zero stars.\n\nRead on their website that they perform same day Covid PCR tests.  Scheduled an appointment through their website.  When I went in for my scheduled time, I was informed that they did not have the same day test at that location and that I could only get the test that takes 2-5 days and costs DOUBLE the amount.  Receptionist could not have been ruder and told me it clearly says that on their website.\n\nNOWHERE on the website and their scheduling platform does it say this.  I just went back and double checked to confirm this.","668167":"Overpriced and expired products. Wish this place was better since Whole Foods is a bit of a walk from my house. Everything is overpriced. Purchased a dip from here the other day, got it home, and realized it had already expired two days ago.","678666":"The only urgent thing for me was to find a bathroom in the area, whew! Like non existent in most parts of the city^","680619":"Not a long wait but wow you walk in and they don't speak because they want you to check in on the machine. Then they call you up with an attitude and ask \"why you here?\" In a what you want attitude. Not welcoming at all. This is the same everytime I literally forget about this interaction because I don't come frequently. Just because it's in a poor neighborhood the service doesn't have to be that way. You literally interact with them for probably 4 minutes in total and this shouldn't be the experience! You can't be nice for 4 minutes get another job.","684192":"This place is horrible!!!!!!  10 people in the lobbying over a hour! No staff! If you don't have staff it should be an appointment only facility!  I will never come back here! Hire more people! It's truly ghetto as hell here","685805":"Under new owner\/management, same people as Palm Tree Markets. Used to love this place, have been going here for over 10 years. They recently fired their manager and all their long-time employees due to \"renovations,\" to open an Asian themed food bar, encouraging them to re-apply afterwards (!?), appalling, will boycott. Too expensive anyway, glorified bodega.","685900":"Expensive and sell expired products! The asian guy saying he's the manager not even worthy of being a \"manager\". Wanted to ask him question but he's too busy being on the phone with his airpods in!! Who runs this store??! Definitely not coming back here.","694150":"The customer service at this place is horrendous. I've been in to have blood taken several times and there's always a problem the last time it was they forgot to run half the tests requested and I had to go back to have more blood drawn. Then the results never got sent to my Dr. Today I called to see if my Dr had sent an order over and the receptionist snickered at me and told me they were taking care of patients and to call back in the morning. F her.  I hung up on her and called my Dr to have my order sent elsewhere. Don't bother going to this cluster f.","696104":"OMG I wish they appreciated customers like we appreciate them. So sad the same miserable unfriendly human being that does not belong in customer service is again at the register.\nNot only is she rude but pretty ignorant.\nI told her I forgot to give her my fab key for coupons and  Ya know what she said  the transaction has gone through already. REALLY\nAs soon as competition comes there way which it will be \nI will gladly give my business to people are grateful ...","700249":"I love having Essene so close to home and lately find myself choosing it over Whole Foods for most things: fresh food and juices, great organic selection, fantastic supplements section, and even though it may not have a zillion selections in the produce section what they carry is almost always the best quality with special care to include items grown nearby. Go Essene! (I'm waiting for them to open in 45 minutes *_*).","700934":"I lived in Philly years ago, but this was my very favorite place to eat and shop.  My favorite was fresh meals that they served daily that much later found out was macrobiotic .  It was amazing and delicious!!  I always felt good after I ate there.  At the time thought it was just health food, but then years later found a cookbook on Amazon written by the store owners, and I was like....oooohhhhh, so that was the macrobiotic diet. \n  Every friend that came through town, I brought them here to eat.   They loved the food too. \n\n I now live in Portland Or. and, yeah there is great food here, miss this place.  Portland mostly has Gluten-free, organic vegetarian...but not macrobiotic.  (Personally they blame gluten for too much out here!) \n\nOwners: Come open a store\/ restaurant out here!...since I will never be back in Philly again.  Portland is awesome!!!","701337":"I'm with the others who are pining for the former Essene.  There was nothing like it!  The cafe selection of fresh and wholesome low sodium and all natural food has been replaced by bibimbop, which doesn't keep well in a buffet to begin with, and has ingredients like fish sauce and corn syrup?  There are several places to get great made to order bibimbop in this area, I certainly wouldn't pay high buffet salad bar prices for it, just to make it myself with dried up eggs in specially designated plastic containers nonetheless.  Nothing about that has anything to do with Essene. \nI also dislike the large deli meat section that has taken over the fridge case.  \nI loved Essene the way it was, I wish they would bring back the old menu and philosophy behind their food.  I'm worried overtime more of it will disappear...\nPlease bring back the healthy and delicious vegetarian buffet!","702037":"I could and almost do eat there everyday. Any chance I can introduce this place to someone I do. Always something delicious at the hot bar. People are always friendly. For the quality of it all I say its priced fairly inexpensive. My dad introduced me to Essene when i was 9. Loved it ever since","705018":"This place had mulberries and I have been looking everywhere for them!!! I went here for the Joe Cross book signing and loved that 95% of the store is organic!!\n\nThe prices are a bit extreme, but I am used to paying those kind of prices...\n\nThe customer service is subpar, that's the only down fall...some staff did not know the products in the store..","705962":"Much like the user A.K., I also had a horrific experience. I went a few weeks ago for some tests, and unfortunately the test had to be thrown out due to it being expired. Despite that being a little odd, I thanked them for at least letting me know and overall I moved on. This past Sunday I visited Vybe. Feeling beyond under the weather and barely able to truly get through my work day, I was seen by Dr. Beg (spelling may be incorrect.) She proceeded to almost make a mockery of me, barely doing a full inspection, asking me about my hands that have nothing to do with the fact that I was coughing up a lung and I felt like my chest was collapsing, but for some reason she had to comment on the look of my hands? Not too sure about that one. Lastly, she offered me cough syrup despite the fact she essentially said I have absolutely nothing wrong with me and perhaps I just have some allergies. It is now Tuesday, I have a severe sinus infection, walking pneumonia, and I am on two antibiotics plus three other medications to help heal the pain my chest and body are in. As A.K. said, if you are a doctor without a job- apply here, or if you want free drugs and not care, come here. My doctor was able to fit me in after my bad experience here, and I am now recovering.","711167":"Vybe was incredibly helpful! I have a broken ankle and had been wearing a splint applied at the hospital for a week. The splint was too tight and was causing me a lot of pain, and I still had a week to go until surgery. The physician at Vybe re-wrapped my splint to be clean and much more comfortable. I'm super grateful they were able to take care of my leg on a Sunday afternoon.","712564":"Do not go to 6060 Ridge Ave\nPhiladelphia, PA,  location or any locations..\nfor a covid pcr test with an appointment and expect to get out of there quickly. This is April 2021 not March 2020. You are required to see a doctor while a rapid test does not require to see a doctor. These are the stories I was told today . Then after being there an hour and I said why is everyone going in front of me. My name was on the top of the list and others were able to go in front of me. Some aid came in annoyed that I was annoyed began to yell at me. Telling me some lies and they were lies that the person in front of me had covid and had to push him in front of the line. I heard the whole story when the man checked in and he came in for a test to get on a plane. Bad service, lying to patient and terrible working procedures. I guess they don't have any patient confidentiality... telling other patient who's got what is illegal...It definitely left me some #bad#vybes","720931":"Horrible Experience- blood results sent to a physician I have never heard of, who faxed the results to my primary doctor.  On top of that the results were totally unlike any I had before in my life so my physician questions if they were even my results.  I called the draw station who said they didn't have me signed in that day- however, they took my insurance card and drivers license and all the lab orders.  It took me 30 minutes on the phone with them to finally find my name on the list.  They gave me customer service who was terribly rude and said there isn't anything they can do for me.  When I asked for a supervisor she put me on hold for 22 minutes.  I know mistakes happen in healthcare - but how about some kind words and saying you understand and are very sorry for the error.  However the supervisor was very helpful and offered several options for having the blood retested at no charge.","735869":"I went here a few years ago to have a CT scan of my knee after an injury. The scan itself was quick and painless. However, I left without a cell phone as someone had taken it from my locker where my things were kept. They did little to help and said they checked security footage but saw nothing. It was a huge ordeal to replace it and didn't help that I had no other means of communication and an injured knee. Horrible experience that I never wish to repea","735888":"I've been coming here since Sept '15 & there has not been one time when the service was not excellent! From the moment that you walk through the doors every staff member is pleasant & attentive. I kind of look forward to my visit because I know this type of treatment isn't guaranteed at my next destination. I highly, highly recommend their services and am proud to be a patient.","738900":"I got there early because I didn't make an appointment. It was a line there when i arrived at 7:45am, as soon as it hit 8:00am the doors opened. The waiting room was clean and they had a tv on to view until they called your name. Once in the back, they tell you to put all your items in a drop box, that has a key. You wash your hands, and off you go to the restroom to give them a urine sample. Quick and fast. At the end you are given your id back and a copy of your paperwork. I would go again. The lady at the front desk was nice.","750400":"I'm not a fan of getting blood work done and especially not the fasting 12 hours before.  But, I  must say, this was a seamless experience.\n\nI arrived about 15 minutes before my appointment and was immediately checked in.  They got me in 5 minutes before my actual appointment time and the entire process took less than 3 minutes, which is a miracle, considering I usually have technicians poke and prod my veins for awhile until they find one they like.\n\nThe office is rather dingy and the door opening to the office looks like it would be a mechanical closet or something.  But they get the job done quickly, which I appreciate.","779946":"A family-owned health food store knowledgeably serving the Germantown community for decades. I feel foolish for only recently visiting this roasted peanut fragranced haven, having grown up in the neighborhood. Now that I've met Al, this will be my source for supplements and teas.","782975":"Quick and fast! The staff are so nice and accommodating. I was in and out in the blink of an eye.  Not too crowded and very clean.  A really nice environment to get your lab work completed. I will definitely be back!","784372":"Told me my blood work would be only $50 copay.\nThen I got hit with $500.00 bill.  The receptionist who checked my insurance coverage was clearly incompetent.","785795":"Do not go to this place.  Seriously, don't!  Incredibly unprofessional, they kept mistaking me for someone else and almost did the wrong tests on me even after I had corrected them once, the person behind the desk \/ on the phone was EXTREMELY unfriendly and unhelpful, and my results weren't actually sent to my doctor until I called a week later and spent a half hour on hold\/ being juggled on the customer service line.  stay away.","787141":"I would give a rating of no stars or a negative number, if  I could. The place is dingy, and the staff is incompetent. They couldn't get my name right, although they had paperwork right in front of them with my name clearly spelled. The person doing intake appeared to be extremely unsure of how to use a computer. A lab technician appeared in the waiting room with his lab coat awry, as if he'd been doing something he shouldn't in the back room. What an unprofessional atmosphere this place has! No one on the staff appears to take any pride in his\/her work. Avoid this place like the plague. There are other, better-managed Labcorp locations, not to mention Quest Diagnostics, which is definitely a better place to go!","798686":"I needed to get allergy testing done, and this lab is quite close to my home. I was a bit worried because of some of the reviews, but I had a great experience (well, as great as can be when you're getting stuck with a needle!). \n\nI made a 7:45 appointment, arrived on time, and was taken back to a room at 7:55. I cannot remember the name of the woman who drew my blood, but she was fantastic- I didn't even feel the usual pinch of the needle when it was inserted. I was out of there by 8:05, after also having to leave a urine sample. Done and done- just the way I like it!","812439":"I've been sitting here for 37 minutes and they have called up 2 people to the desk to process paperwork. They have nobody working here. 15 people are waiting. Total wait time likely to be at least 2 hrs. Labcorp ceo and upper management should all be fired. They have no clue what's going on and people should not be subjected to this.","814450":"I have been coming here for MRI\/CT\/x-Ray from about October 2015. I have been getting bi monthly MRI\/CT since then, my most recent being May 2nd 2016.\nI can say that everyone here that I have met have been super nice and helpful, and also a sense of humor. \nThey make scheduling easy coordinating my scans back to back. \nGreat Job everyone  until the next one...\n\nI wanted to add that people come here for a lot of serious stuff( myself included) not just for toe x-rays Etc. The staff manage to maintain that balance of seriousness with lightheartedness that seems to put most people at ease, allows you relax somewhat and take out some of the stress of being there and let the staff do what they do best.","819286":"I go here to get the black seed oil..it really does wonders for all types of conditions..i would recommend this place of  business to all","822143":"Nice staff but always run 15 minutes late EVEN with scheduled appointment. Staff could manager there Time more effectively. 8 clients waiting. 2 people in chairs waiting and 4 lab techs just chatting in the back room about there weekend","834965":"I came by for a urine drug screen with an appointment and still had to wait over an hour. It seemed to be that people were getting taken in the order they came in, regardless of appointment time. In the afternoon there is only 1 person working in the office, she is responsible for everything in the front (check ins and drop offs) and everything in the back as well (lab draws, labeling specimens, observed urine drug screen). Many people in the waiting room were leaving because they could no longer wait...The solution to this is that they need to have more than 1 person working in the afternoon when the waiting room is filled with 10-15 people!!","849164":"I keep saying it and I really do mean it...First impressions are lasting. I only used this facility because my insurance covers this place. I must say, once I got past the front desk the visit was fine. The technician was nice. No issues with the actual service. The issue I have was with the person at the front window. She was not the most customer services oriented individual. She was a little impatient with patients and I could see her actually roll her eyes. When she finally called me in to get my blood drawn, a man stepped up to the window to see where his name was. She practically yelled at him that it was not his turn. OK so may have been having a bad day but she should not have been at the front window.","850474":"Opens at 7:30, I arrived 7:10. Employee no regard for privacy, called my SS # last 4 digits across room!!! Still waiting to take work urine test (new job) at 10 + minutes. They don't care about privacy or timeliness!!!","859646":"Support staff are exceptional. 5 star.\n\nPoorly  stocked. No ice packs to give to patients, not even a bag of ice for a large painful bruise acquired on the job from misplaced stuff on the floor. They refused to give me plain Tylenol.\n\nXray equipment is outdated, they still use film so delay in getting a read. \n\nIf you are injured at work and have a choice, try another site. If you are an employer, think twice about sending staff here. They will leave unnecessarily upset.\n\nProviders here are burned out and have trouble listening and therefore determining a reasonable plan of care. Just mean because they can be. And a cursory exam too. I know that I did not  receive appropriate medical care.","862049":"This is hands-down the best Quest in the city.  The staff working at the front desk were the friendliest I've ever encountered at ANY medical establishment, the phlebotomist was extremely professional, and the office was spotless.\n\nI had about a 20 minute wait (even with an appointment), but I didn't mind at all because everything else about my visit was so overwhelmingly positive.\n\nThe Quests at 828 Chestnut and 227 N. Broad are much closer to my apartment, but this was totally worth the extra travel.","872104":"Jumping Jehoshaphat, Batman! How can you screw up the one and only thing you have been hired for, the thing that you do every day, multiple times a day, repeatedly, over and over?!?! Apparently if you are an employee for Labcorp on 8th St. and Chestnut St. you can, big time!\nThe waiting time was normal, about 10 minutes with four people in the waiting room, the administrative process took even less. The real fun, however, started when I was told to go to any open station and give my paperwork to the phlebotomist. The \"lobotomist\" (probably a victim of the procedure) probably mistook me for a pin cushion because she decided that my normally visible and easily accessible veins are for noobs and that punctured veins are all the rage these days. She saw my veins and like a Toreador, she charged me with the needle as if I was a piece of prime rib and POP goes the needle through my vein! You would think that she understood it by the lack of blood flow or by the way my arm started changing colors. A mere minute of trying to collapse my vein and she gave up vanquished. But wait, she must have realized that the medial basilic vein splits in two and Labcorp takes no prisoners! POP  goes the other vein, but the tortur...errr the phlebotomist wouldn't take no for an answer, several pokes laetr and she is in the vein...I don't know how she managed it but she indeed extracted the 0.000002 oz of my blood, wished me a good weekend and sent me to frolic in the streets of Philadelphia.\n\nP.S: Don't try to use their hand sanitizers, they are broken or just don't like you.","879896":"I was sent here since that is where my insurance had me capitated to  (never understood how that works, as it was Quest for me until I changed my primary care doc, but hey...). Very convenient to transportation in Center City and pretty easy to find on the 2nd floor.\n\nI think I was in and out of the place within 5 minutes. I was the 3rd person in line when I arrived, and we were all seen rapidly. They drew the bloods real quick and painless (ah it should always be that way with needles :-P), and the results got back to my doctor very soon afterwards. Can't really ask for better than that.\n\nNot quite 5 stars since the staff came across as a tad gruff and short, but mostly they were courteous and quick, and they got the job done well.","881766":"Freaking pathetic. Waited forever while the employees farted around and talked amongst themselves. Had surgery scheduled for two weeks later and told them the test results must be expedited. Quest delayed getting the results to the surgeon and and I had to have the tests redone while I was waiting for surgery. The Quest has been annoying the shit out of me trying to get me to pay for the tests because my insurer wouldn't pay fir the tests because they had already been done, by the surgeons office while I was waiting for surgery.  Quest has been annoying as hell. I would never use Quest again and suggest you use any testing service besides them. There are both hospital based testing services and LabCorp testing right in the neighborhood.","893408":"First of all, they moved. Same block. Closer to 8th Street. Phone number no longer works. Contact them through the Labcorp website. \n\n* Place is very dingy for a medical facility \n\n* People were nice, but lacked even a modicum of customer service skills. \n\n* Process for anything wasn't explained or posted. Finding out how to schedule, check in, where to go for the work, all required interrogation. \n\n* I made an appointment, but they ignored that and took us first arrived, first served, appointment or not. \n\n* Sent me to the back. Four rooms. Didn't tell me which. When I asked, I was told to just pick an empty one. \n\n* Technician didn't know what order to serve us as we weren't assigned the rooms we were in. \n\n* Technician was nice and competent. \n\nThe problems are managerial, not with individual personnel. \n\nThe facilities in Ft. Washington and Jenkintown don't have these problems. Next time, I will go to a different facility.","907839":"Sigh. This particular place is run by incompetents. Here's a tip - be there when they first open or experience the mind-numbing inefficiency and incompetence that is Quest Diagnostics.\n\nHere's why:\n\n-You can make an appointment, sure, and still wait 45+ minutes. It's first come, first served. Appointments are pointless. We showed up at 10:40. It's now 11:25 and ticking...\n\n-If you're picking up a kit, you still need to wait along with everyone else who made an appointment to pee in a cup.\n\n-Phone has been ringing off the hook. Staff will not answer your calls.\n\n-Speaking of staff not answering your calls, the lady at the front desk has been making personal calls while the phone has been ringing off the hook and people are waiting to pee in a cup, pick up a kit, wait in line, slowly die in frustration.\n\nQuest Diagnostics has no competition and therefore zero incentive to improve the customer experience or efficiently manage their operations.","910502":"I keep saying it and I really do mean it...First impressions are lasting.

First it's winter in Philadelphia and the waiting room is freezing.  Everyone is setting here bundled up in their winter coats. Seriously.\n\nNext and this is a pet peeve against the medical industry as a whole, why givw me a 10 am appointment if the true time isn't going to be until 1130??  \"Registration\" took 10 minutes.\n\nI would say go somewhere else but the reality is poor customer service is the standard","956083":"I needed blood drawn for pre-op testing and I had to use a Labcorp office versus, say, Quest Disagnostics because this is the company my insurance covers fully.  I found this office in Center City on their website.  It's quite hard to find being labyrinth-like suite of offices on the 2nd floor of the old Ben Franklin hotel (which I discovered isn't a hotel any longer!)  The office is pretty dinghy.  But the service was fast and no-nonsense.  I think the results got to my doctor quickly because I didn't hear otherwise.  On the plus side I peeked into the ballroom from the end of Silver Linings Playbook on the way out.","964458":"I had a positive experience here. Making an appointment was super easy. Upon arrival everyone was very nice and friendly. I only waited 5 minutes to go back for my ultrasound. The ultrasound technician was very professional and kind. I was done in about 15 minutes. They validate your parking (free) if you park at the building attached to the facility. Overall a great experience!","993013":"Easy to create and update an appointment and retrieve laboratory results. Excellent staff.","1007902":"This is my second review, so it's a short one. \n\nI am still coming here for my imaging needs bi monthly, sometimes more. \n\nEvery time I come here everyone is always super nice to me. I don't want to start naming names because you always leave someone out.\n\nEveryone is caring and professional.","1019644":"This is a great place to find all the herbs and vitamins you need daily.  The staff are extremely helpful with answering questions and offering information with all the goods they have to offer.   You'll find rare items that only can be found online which you will have to wait at least a day, and most likely pay for shipping.  As an added bonus, I have found most of their items to be less expensive than the competition.","1035068":"I went in for an MRI recently after having to reschedule. The staff was so nice to me. They took me back at my scheduled time, there really wasn't any wait time. The girl, whose name I can't remember right now, put my IV in and for the first time in a long time went without a hitch especially since it was my hand. I had the pleasure of Andrews company while I was being scanned. He made me feel real comfortable. Asked me some questions so he could get a better feel for where to scan. Very professional. I'm sure I'll be going there for any imaging needs I may have later in the future!","1043669":"This place is horrible. I came here for a drug screen for a new job and had to wait over an hour to give a urine sample. The medical assistants were nasty and I was in there for a total of 4 hours. 3 hours was spent waiting. I don't know why these companies will not use some one else for occupation health. I'm not going back!","1056199":"All my family of 4 used the facility from the day they opened. Everything was great. Today after my appointment I asked for a ride back home. They keep the driver Misha with the Van that provide patient ride.  I don't know what power Misha has in MNAP , but  all employee Angela and others told me that it's up to him. Even I was scheduled for the stress test for June they can't schedule me for ride until Misha approve it. He was hiding from me in the van about 30 minutes parking van from one parking lot to another around the plaza. Management didn't responded to me. I took a private ride back home. Very strange.","1067437":"Lots of sunlight in the waiting room and plenty of parking in the back. The staff here at the front desk is friendly and efficient. Come here for walk in DOT drug tests or physicals. A DOT physical here is super efficient!!!! The doctor is knowledgeable and friendly.","1070123":"Well, my mother started buying their products in 1970... She remained a loyal customer until she.moved to Virginia, in 1993.\n\nThroughout the years this health and nutrition store has served the community in an outstanding manner. They have a wide variety of items, knowledgeable personnel and always provide friendly and professional service.\n\nMaplewood Nutrition & Dietary Food Shop is simply the best.","1089399":"Here for an pre employment physical, my appointment was for 1:00pm it's now 1:46pm and I haven't been called yet, went to the front to see why I was still waiting because 2 others were called before me I was told, oh they're just getting something done real quick, umm not my problem I have a scheduled appointment. Now onto my physical as there are no female Dr's here I'm very uneasy about seeing a male Dr, from what the medical assistant told me it's just him checking my lungs and me doing some strenuous things to see if I'm fit for  the job the medial assistant did ask if I wanted her in the room and I said yes so thank you for that. I hope I never have to return here for anything moving forward","1089674":"Best new practice in town. Old fashioned medicine up to speed in the 21st century.\nLabs are drawn in the office and they do a lot of basic testing there too.","1090862":"Jefferson location for X-rays, CT scans, etc.   Very friendly and competent staff.  On time appointments and free parking with validation in lot that is right next door.   Located at the corner of 9th and Walnut.","1109463":"Getting old sucks. I was here to get xrays of a body part that is falling apart.\n\nFirst of all, it's hard to find because it's actually located on the bottom floor of what most people think of as Wills Eye Hospital. There's a little round curved driveway in front of the building. The entrance is located next to this driveway on the ground floor.  I had a hard time finding it and must've walked by it twice!\n\nThere was a mix up about a primary doctor referral so the staff were very kind and helpful to try to help it get sorted out. Actual x ray itself took a few minutes and was handled by Tori, a technician who was very efficient.\n\nThey offer appointments that start as early as 7 AM for those of us poor working folks.\n\nPRO TIPS. Closest PATCO stop is 9th and Locust, a 5 minute walk.","1127851":"I did a walk-in drug screening at this place on Saturday. I looked up their hours from 8am-12pm. I arrived at 11am and they have a strange man who is clearly not in a sober state tell me to leave. I ignored him and walked in anyway to sign-in. They announced they close at 12PM and will not take anyone else because they want to close on time so I left and went back Monday.\n\nI walked in on a Monday morning so I was the only one there. I saw that there was only one receptionist so I checked in using the kiosk. I waited about 15 minutes before the receptionist\/the lady who did my test finished playing with her phone and called me up. She sounded bored and it was Monday morning so I get it, you don't feel like being friendly. I waited maybe another 15 minutes, while I watch two other people walk in, before she asked me if I am ready to give her a urine sample. When I was ready, she told me to come to the back and grab my own cup. I did not know patrons have to dig through all the lab draws to find a laboratory cup. Usually that is the tester's job to hand the patron the necessary materials rather than have them dig through lab facilities. That's very unprofessional and lazy on her end. She incoherently mumbled a bunch of instructions and pointed me to the bathroom while rolling her eyes at me.\n\nThe bathroom inside was absolutely disgusting! The toilet itself is duck taped and smelly! They didn't even have toilet paper this early in the morning. When I finished and informed the receptionist about the lack of toilet paper, she gave me a dirty look, snatched my sample and told me to wash my hands and leave with the most awful sneer. She threw my receipt and ID on the side and made her way back to the front desk.\n\nIn a nutshell, the employees here are lazy, rude and disrespectful in so many ways. Hire professional people..SERIOUSLY! Plenty of people are looking for jobs and willing to do a much better job than these lazy people that only wants to get paid to play on their phones all day!","1134847":"I hate getting blood taken.  Who doesn't!  I made an appointment for 730AM.  It ended up snowing that morning and since I live in the mountains, I mean, Manayunk it took some extra time to get there.  \nI arrives at 745, was promptly greeted and taken back. It didn't matter that I was late there was only people waiting for the bus in the waiting room. \nThey had 2 techs on staff which is a nice change from my local Quest.  I don't think it is very safe for them to only have 1 person alone at these locations.  They were quick and friendly.  Hit my vein and painlessly drew 7 vials of blood.","1152481":"Horrible place to get an mri done. There scheduling department is so rude and billing department  is so condescending. Do not recommend","1162110":"Had an appointment at 2.15. Supposed to be 30 minutes. Still here 1 hour later no one can tell me anything. Paperwork is lost. I guess because its Jefferson they dont care to make sure the patient is taken care of. They are about money. I miss drs offices that care about the patients. Your just a number here","1165214":"I used to see Dr. Vicki Bralow at her old practice and came to the new practice and was introduced to her husband. Dr. Scott Bralow. I had a great first visit.

They have everything from herbs, teas, honey, protein, vitamins, supplements, vegetarian foods, snack mixes, and all natural beauty products. The staff is very knowledgeable, and very helpful! They also sell FRESH HOT roasted peanuts that taste as delicious as they smell! Definitely worth the trip to Germantown.","1186022":"I heard about this practice on Facebook and made an appointment to see Dr. Bralow - and wow. From the moment I walked in, I immediately felt welcomed as if I had been a long term client. I initially went in to discuss MM and it went from that to now switching to him and his wife as my new primary. Other patients seemed very happy and satisfied and I have been a long term patient at U Penn but it was really lacking that nurturing care that I felt I needed. I'm recommending Dr. Bralow to all of my family and friends if you are in the South Philly, Center City region. GO HERE! They also told me that anyone looking for self-pay, they are reasonably priced and LGBTQ friendly!","1187576":"What's the point of making an appointment online when you still have to wait 40 minutes in the waiting area. First time here and will be last. I will go back to use labcorp from now on.","1195780":"I would like to file a complaint against your South Philadelphia Employee Renee Jones (she wore Muslim attire, blue head wrap with matching blue clothes) and the other employee, whose name I don't have but she is an older African American woman with light brown hair, glasses, and a curly pony-tail at:\n\nQuest Diagnostis Lab \n2219 S Broad St.\nPhiladelphia, PA 19148 \n\nI made an appointment to complete a biometric screening through my employer Penn Medicine Jiff app, as participation in the WellFocused program. I arrived on time for the 11:30AM appointment on 06\/15\/19, but the door was already locked although the time is clearly displayed on the door stating that the lab doesn't close until 12:00PM on Saturdays. A woman told me that she was there for a 10:45AM appt and the door was locked by 10:30AM. A man (another patient) came to the door from the inside and told me through the door, that the staff said they are not taking  (accepting) anymore people. I told him through the door that I had an 11:30 appointment. The woman with the glasses, light brown hair and curly ponytail told him to tell me to wait. I was left waiting for a half hour. Another Penn Medicine employee also arrived with an appointment for 11:45AM. Your employees never opened the door. Another patient let us in and Renee Jones was rude, unprofessional and berated me in front of a room full of people. She said she couldn't find my appointment but I had the email confirmation, and appointment reminder on my phone along with my printed paperwork. Renee said it wasn't in the system so she doesn't have to see me. She refused to look at my proof and yelled at me in front of the other patients. This goes beyond unprofessional! Renee eventually let me complete the test, but the same woman who berated me she couldn't locate my appointment, is the only qualified professional to draw my blood?\n\nRenee also breached HiPAA protocol by stating that another patient whose full name she stated, last name Davis, was completing a drug test in front of other patients. I don't care that most people complete drug tests here, we're not supposed to know why people are there, REGARDLESS! That is what paperwork and the lab system is for! How is this lab still open without a lawsuit!? I had to listen to both employees complain about how bad the job is, and they're looking for a new job and they're putting in their 2 weeks notice, and they shouldn't have to put up with this, and how poorly staffed the company is. Renee mentioned doing hair on the side and how she doesn't need this money. Curly ponytail with the glasses said she was just only there to make extra money.\n\nAt what point will management decide to step in to address the complaints already made about this place and replace the rude and unprofessional staff who clearly doesn't like working here!? Check the google reviews, I wish I would have done that first. There are so many people looking for a job and it's upsetting to know that Quest is willing to keep people like this employed!","1199969":"The worst experience when it comes to making an appointment! How difficult can it be to process each call in line?\n4 attempts of waiting for at least 45 minutes, finally getting first in line, got the call dropped. No options to schedule online. No other options. Period.","1207246":"I walked in for X rays without an appointment, around opening time, and was in and out within 30 minutes. The staff was helpful, and everyone was nice. Tori took my X rays. She is the best! She was kind and friendly, and she explained everything she was doing and why.

I have always been treated like a number and not a patient with medical needs, making me feel uncomfortable to trust my doctor. My experience at this office was the opposite of all of my experiences, I was treated like a patient. Dr. Bralow was down to earth, professional, asked me all the questions and took his time with me for my first intake appointment.  He made sure all of my questions were answered, and the woman at the front desk was just as pleasant. I'm so happy to finally have a doctor who actually cares about their patients, and I feel confident in knowing all of my medical needs will be taken care of. I highly highly recommend this office!","1238918":"Paradise compared to Labcorp.

I've never been scared of needles but they are rough at this location and it hurts a lot more than it should. I've been here several times this year and the last two times have been traumatizing. I've never had such big bruises from bloodwork in my life. I will avoid going to this location from now on. Getting bloodwork shouldn't have to be this painful.","1323418":"I would never return to such a facility because I was treated simply as a number and not a person. The two woman that took my paperwork were fairly pleasant by the way. No disrespect to them in any way.","1324474":"I was VERY impressed with the staff at this Labcorp yesterday (@ 11am on Monday 4\/5\/21).  There was a line of people and this staff was flying.  You know when there is a line at the bank or some place and the people working behind the counter are moving in slow motion?  Well, not this crew.  \n\nThe front reception lady was fast and efficient (she was calmly helping someone who didn't have their paper work and instead of any attitude, she calmly and compasionately helped the lady).  And the two techs in back were literally running between clients.  I watches and listen to how they interacted - quickly, calmly with some friendly chatter to make everyone calm. They wiped down and disinfected between each person.  Super efficient, super friendly.  Exceptional!!  A real amazing team servicing in a stressful environment.  THANK YOU for your hard work and compassion.  Your hard work is appreciated!","1336466":"Went there to get my blood drawn and other medical testing and Dr. Vicki is the best! Also Bindi Tuesday's are the funnest thing ever. Definitely go here!","1338060":"Its easy to write a bad experience that traumatizes you, as it stimulates your endorphins to dance around. However when you have such a positive experience it makes a greater impression than bad one - everyone deserves to know, there's a good center in town!  NO ONE RUSHES you - not the doc - not the assistants or the nurses and the doctor - take plenty of time to listen, to take time to be PRESENT. Great Service.  Very satisfied with procedure!","1353375":"Dr. Bralow is the best. Very nice and helpful. Always easy to reach. It is great to have someone available at all times that knows my history and can give advice. Great resources with blood work and gives very useful health information based on her diagnostics. Also had fantastic covid updates during the thick of the pandemic. Highly recommend","1354005":"Jefferson imaging did x-rays, never sent me a bill (MyChart said zero balance so didn't think I owed anything), yet referred my bill to a collection agency without bothering to contact me.  No voicemail, no email, no letter--nothing.\n\nApparently Jefferson imaging is separate and administers billing separate through InstaMed (owned by JP Morgan, go figure).\n\nHow was I supposed to know that radiology has an entirely separate billing department (especially if they never sent me a bill)?  And when Jefferson (misleadingly, it turns out) represents that everything is on MyChart?  My imaging is there, so why aren't my bills?\n\nThis place should not be held out as part of \"Jefferson.\"  \n\nNow I have to deal with a collection agency and possibly credit-reporting agencies because Jefferson screwed up.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague.  If you go, be prepared to be surprised by a bill or a collection letter.","1378697":"This place is a joke. Severely understaffed and no regard for anyone else's life or schedule. There's literally a secretary and one person for testing. Save yourself a day of frustration and go somewhere else.\n\nUpdate: Still waiting 1 hour later (2 hours total)\n\nUpdate: There's actually only one person working\n\nUpdate: I applied for and accepted a job with Quest. I'm now helping to move things along.","1380626":"Trash service. They begin by having you sign a disclosure agreement that allows them to send your information to basically anyone they want where option 5 clearly says that you don't have to sign and give them permission and they'll still give you medical treatment. At least right up until you try to give them the paper and they say that they can't provide said medical treatment unless you sign away your privacy. Turns out that you're better off being turned away because all the doctor is going to do is touch your injured area multiple times only to say it isn't an injury.  Glad this pain disappeared the moment you said that and your magic thumb cured me .... Oh wait, it's still here. You wonder y ppl question doctor's credentials?! the only reason you still have a job is because companies pay you to cheat injured employees out of help they deserve. You should be ashamed.","1385634":"One star is for the receptionist. I took a day off work to get an MRI (brain with contrast-so a little anxiety to begin with) only to get there and be told I was supposed to be there at 7:30 - and I need to reschedule. The next available appointment they have is a month away. I received two calls prior to my appointment advising me to be there at 8 am including the call the night before when I specifically asked if I needed to be there early or before appt time for paperwork or needed to fast etc -and was told no to all. \nSo I basically just blew a vacation day, spent an hour on SEPTA that I didn't need to and need to now go through the gyrations of rescheduling. I know this happens all the time but most people get anxiety about getting these things done for fear of the worst outcome. Shouldn't they have some accountability for making sure they prepare a patient? I'm pretty sure Jefferson has had a couple prior patients getting mri's - does everyone show up to \"you were supposed to be here a half hour before your scheduled appt time - you now need to reschedule\". I am now looking at another month of worrying.","1387990":"Terrible terrible service and policy. I took my very sick elderly mother to have blood work done today for an issue she is having. We were told they wouldn't do her blood work unless we provided a credit or debit card. When I explained that my mother is poverty level and doesn't own a credit or debit card, we were told they wouldn't be able to perform the service. I asked if they really didn't have something in place for people who don't own these things (I know it is odd for today's day and age, but she can't be the only person), they said no. So, I asked if they could just bill her if there's a balance, she said no. So, I said you're denying a physician's order to have her blood work done. She said yes. I was completely appalled. We are in the middle of a health pandemic and people are being denied service because they don't own a credit or debit card??? What world is this!!! Needless to say, I've already reported them to the health department and the news. This is a disgrace!!! I took her to Labcorp and they had no issues doing the blood work. Definitely recommend them! They are located at 1703 S Broad Street...highly recommend!","1401644":"The overall wait for a walk in was very quick and easy but the girl who took my blood mid 40s 50s black woman shoved the shit of a needle hard as hell in my arm for no freaking reason. Like Bitch it's skin, not fucking rubber!!! That shit hurt and pissed the the fuck off!!! Then she had to do it twice cause she couldn't find the vein. If she's there to take your blood. RUN!! Go to a different location","1402232":"The customer service here SUCKS. \nI come here because it's close to my home but every time I come I regret it. I waited for over an hour for a three hour test. They called my name and completely butchered it, I only realized it was me because my name was taken off the wait list. There's no one in the front desk so hollering when someone walks across is your only option. To then be ignored with eye contact. The wait list has said 3 mins for the last hour.","1461604":"Wonderful spot! The staff is super courteous and the doctors and clinicians are excellent. I highly recommend this clinic for all of your needs and encourage you to select this Dr.    \nShe was a wonderful and extremely intelligent doctor for all our needs and questions.    \nWe will be back for the next one!","1497925":"I cannot say enough good things about this pharmacy.  They are completely customer focused. I don't need to remember my prescription number when I call in.  Just my name and what drug I need.  When I come in, they know who I am and immediately know what I am picking up.  They have a little of everything in the store.  Are they as stocked to the brim with \"everything\" like a Walmart - No.  But they always have what I need and I am a person to them not a \"Next in Line\".  I highly recommend you give them a try.  They can easily transfer your existing prescriptions over and you will never want to go anywhere else again for your pharmacy needs.","1502148":"Friendly, local, and familiar - that's how I would describe Chestnut Hill Pharmacy.\n\nThe staff here work quickly and are relational with customers. They remember my family and that we are from the neighborhood. The store has plenty of essentials and if there is anything you need they will order it for you. \n\nI will continue to support this pharmacy because they are making an effort to keep Chestnut Hill a wonderful place for residents and visitors alike.","1505199":"I am so happy that this place is here. I really don't even have to say my name when I come in they know me and bring my scrip to the counter. They also call my doc if they notice anything awry. I hope they will always be there.","1527599":"Not sure about the acupuncture services, but it does have a very extensive collection of Chinese herbs and mushrooms--don't get too excited, they are not psychotropic (I don't think). Anyway, they also may not speak too much proper English, so it's best to do your own research online or through another herbal company, just to double-check interractions and that sort of thing. Penn herb may be good for that, or check out dragonherbs.com. Service is friendly, nonetheless.","1538884":"Went in without an appointment, the lovely receptionist greeted me and took me right away. Annette did my work and I was in and out within 15 min. Both women working here very pleasant.","1558278":"Chestnut Hill Pharmacy is as good as it gets. They provide outstanding, personalized service with the highest degree of professionalism, expertise, and friendliness. The contrast with the chain stores like CVS is like night and day. At CVS you are a number. At CH Pharmacy you are a person with a family whose medical concerns and children are known by name. The benefits of going to CH Pharmacy, including a higher standard of personalized care, far, far outweigh any incremental savings found at the big chains. I hope folks will support CH's invaluable contribution to the health and quality of our community, which rests on interpersonal relationships.","1621989":"I called this pharmacy after becoming fed up when cvs could not fill my prescriptions for very basic medication for the 5th or 6th time.  They were very friendly and helpful and I would rather give them business than the cvs down the street any day.  They were pleasant on the phone and helpful and didn't act like I was disturbing them by dropping off a prescription to be filled.","1648563":"I loved Chestnut Hill Pharmacy. I filled a prescription last Thursday, Then Friday when I went to fill another one I surprisingly found them out of business and empty. Idk what happened . No one their said anything about closing when I went in . Also there was no sign on the door last week saying we will no longer be in business after this date. I will miss going here a lot . This was a great personable pharmacy and very convenient to walk to.","1665696":"Dr. Geifman was so knowledgeable and cordial during the ultrasound. It was quick and easy and her consultation was reassuring.","1671207":"Sitting in Labcorp as I'm writing this review. Staff was very short and rude. The entire time I was there I listened to the employees talk about wanting a new job (expletives included) and how they were so much better than this. I know a lot of people aren't happy in their jobs but to talk about it in front of a patient was very rude. The only reason this place gets two stars is because I could have been in and out if I had produced enough urine.","1682670":"Well the waiting room is large and bright, has a TV, and plant life,  which is an improvement over their competitor Quest Diagnostics. \n\nThe staff are hit and miss, either they are annoyed at the entire world and all its inhabitants or they are pleasant and seem to have some care about your well-being. \n\nThey are a full range specimen collection site. They will take everything from your blood and pee to your hair samples for testing.","1695627":"Will not go back and would not recommend anyone. I only went bc my Obgyn was booked and needed the test done asap. The office needs cleaning. The two receptionists up front must have issues with each other bc they kept talking to each other with attitude and rolling their eyeballs to each other. In front of the patients. The tech was nice but when I shared my results with my Obgyn, he told me that she was not suppose to tell me certain things. She kept saying \"my guess is.....\" So that made us nervous. All the techs I have had tell me to wait to speak with my Obgyn. Bottom line, go somewhere else more professional and clean.","1717825":"This place is wonderful.  My brother and I had to go in and get blood work done in an emergency situation, and Annette was FANTASTIC!  It's so nice to have a friendly experience in a medical facility around the holidays!  She was the only person in the office besides some other patients and never looked rushed or overwhelmed.  I could see that everyone in the waiting room looked calm and relaxed, I'm sure due to her ability to create a calm atmosphere in what can be an uncomfortable setting for some.  I also remembered and let her know that there was another circumstance in which I came in contact with her probably six or so months prior in which she was, again, super helpful and pleasant.  Even though that facility wasn't able to provide the solution I needed, she helped me find and call another location and gave me directions!!  I hope that her employer checks Yelp reviews because this woman deserves a raise or a bonus or at the very least a \"job well done\" from her boss!!","1724521":"Great little store. If you're into Chinese herbs, they probably have what you're looking for.  I personally go there for reishi mushroom tea which is great for the immune system.  Service is good, and the people friendly.  Check out their website - http:\/\/www.chinesenaturalherbs.com\/.","1744639":"Awesome I go here I'm always in and out I came in with sugars of 400 and now my sugars are low I'm 7 months with only 2 more months to go and my son is healthy","1786559":"Mama has been on my case about brewing up some herbal soups and tonics for the wintertime; given the fact she speaks only Cantonese, and I can barely speak proper English as it is, I have a rough time figuring out what ingredients she wants me to get. But after falling prey to the incoming fall congestion crawling around my office, I stubbornly set out to find some chuen-pui (untranslatable into English) to brew up my beloved snow pear water.\n\nA few failed stops later, I Yelp'd my way to Long Life Chinese Natural Herbs, which is a cozy little shop full of the Chinese herbal medicine you could ever need. I say this as a child who spent hours at the counters of numerous Chinese apothecaries, drinking down bitter soups and peering at the contents behind those dusty glass counters. No seahorses and bugs in sight at this store, but as soon as I came through the door I knew by the bitter herbal smells that I was where I needed to be.\n\nThe staff are extremely friendly, and we laughed at my attempt in English to explain what I needed -- thankfully, they also speak Cantonese, so knew exactly what I was looking for as soon as I blurted out the ingredient. I asked a few questions about how to brew my preparation, and they had a couple of tips to add alongside mama's recipe, which helped greatly.\n\nIt's strange to think that I have a go-to place for Chinese herbs now, but considering how damned intimidating it is for me to break the language barrier, it's a huge relief to know that there's somewhere friendly that I can find these things.\n\nFor those Westerners that are interested, they do speak English well enough, but it is definitely a place from the old country where you do need some basic knowledge of herbs, or at least know what you're buying.","1793072":"Came here to do a quick drug test for my clinicals. Looked online and called to see when they close and it said 4pm. Arrived and the secretary was right off the bat rude to me and told me drug testing ended at 2pm (I got there at 2:10). She said I should have called and I said I did. She said I was wrong about the time and I said, \"no shit\" but the website and phone call told me different. She told me off and basically turned around and ignored me until I left. Came in next day and the line to wait was incredibly small yet long. I was instructed nicely on what to do but when I was finished, no one was there to tell me what to do! I stood there, holding my cup of pee and not able to even wash my hands because they said so! Disgusting! Once done, I got the hell out.\n\nThe room is in need of repair. Smells like stale body sweat and the wallpapers are peeling off. Movie wasn't even playing on the TV - it was stuck on replay on the home screen! Not great if you were waiting an hour. \n\nOne good thing: results were fast.","1806424":"I walked into the lab at 12.30 pm located on the first floor of 9331 Old Bustleton Ave today. I just wanted to know if my lab order is with Labcorp or Quest.  I walk to the front desk, wrote my name and the front desk receptionist asked me what do I need.  I told her I only need to check if my lab orders from my doctor is with labcorp.  She told me to wait and I will be next in line for someone to help me.  In my mind I know it should take less than 5 seconds to check.  I will be happy to wait if the wait is not too long and so I waited in the waiting room.\n\nI waited for 17 minutes and it was 12.47 pm.  In the 17 minutes at least 3 people walk out and 3 people walk in.  Then I walked to the front desk and asked her what is happening.  She quickly said \"OK you can come in now.\"   When I was about to walk in another lady walk passed me at the front counter to sign in.  I walked into the office and sat in the receptionist cubicle.  Then suddenly the office manager, Tiara, told the receptionist that I should go back out and allow that lady who just walk in because she had a 12.45 pm appointment.  I was shocked that she or the office manager cannot take 5 seconds to check if my lab order is in the system.  The office manager was scolding the receptionist for allowing me into the office while the lady who just walk in have a 12.45 appointment.  The office manager insist that I go back out to the waiting room.\n\nSo I obediently walk back out and another 3 minutes later I walk back into the office.  This time I sat in the office manager's cubicle and I asked her what is her problem.  She said she overheard everything and I jumped queue.  I told her I would gladly wait and respect someone who had an appointment.  I am willing to wait if she tells me if I have a blood work order.  What is the point of waiting and find out later my blood order is in a different lab?  \n\nThen I gave her my driver's license and she told me I do not have a blood order in the system.  It took less than 2 seconds to look it up and she wanted me to wait more than 20 minutes just for this answer.\n\nThen I asked her I need to speak to the manager and she said. \"I am the manager.\"  Then I said, \"Give me your supervisor's name and number. I want to file a complaint.\"  She wrote down her supervisor's name and number. I asked her for her name and she shouted Tiara.  I asked her to write it down but she doesn't want to write it down and said she is too busy.  I asked for her name a second time and she just yell out her name and was extremely rude.  I am assuming it is Tiara.  She is not willing to spell it.\n\nI called Shea and reported the incident to her.  She was apologetic and told me she will speak to Tiara.\n\nPlease do not go there if you don't have to.","1823009":"I accidentally became a customer when my doctor sent a prescription here instead of another Chestnut Hill Pharmacy. It's probably the best \"mess up\" that's ever happened to me.\n\nHere's a short summary of just some of the few good things they've done for me:\n1) I once didn't have enough money on me to pay, so they let me take the RX and come back later to pay.\n2) There was a national shortage of my pills, but they made absolutely sure I had just enough to cover me until they could restock.\n3) They know me by name, when I need to refill, and always have it ready to pick up even though I always forget to call first. They'd probably remember my anniversary if I asked.\n\nThere's certainly more to lavish upon them, but I really just suggest that you go into there and try it out for yourself.","1825346":"Great office.  Everything said about Annette is true.  She's a sweetheart and extremely competent.","1850568":"So I've been going to this location for a few years and other than a long wait time when you don't schedule an appointment I don't ever seem to have an issue. Today I had an appointment at 8:15 and I got my blood drawn and was out of there by 8:30. I usually struggle with getting blood drawn so I always request a butterfly needle, when asked if I could have one used on me I was told no but then the tech shut the door and snuck a butterfly needle for me. Of the times I have gone here I was the most worried this time due to the reviews but don't let the reviews fool you, this place definitely has made some changes for the better.","1854136":"If I could give zero stars, I would!! The pregnancy center does not have anyone in the office a lot of the times during their \"regular business hours\", so you can't get in touch with someone. Also, they have no after hours number, so if you have a question for a doctor or an emergency, you are SOL. \n\nThe ultrasound tech is miserable and will quickly burst your bubble of excitement during your ultrasound. Oh, and she talked to my best friend about how many abortions she had :\/\n\nDon't go there unless it's a last resort. The rooms are extremely outdated, the doctor doesn't even have a real office.","1857706":"Not worth any stars.  Made my husband first time appt today for blood work.  2 women apparently don't like their jobs because were ignorant & couldn't be bother to reply \"good morning\" back!   Husband asked simple question, never there before, on signing in with a very ignorant reply..\"read the sign at kiosk\"....walked out & never got blood drawn.  I reported to our family doctor will never use that location again or for that matter LabCorp since their employees representing the company cant be bothered!   If you don't want to do your job or be at your job stay home!","1858375":"My father is a strange guy. He chooses to see an Amish horse doctor instead of a chiropractor. He ingests lots of toxins, but believes in acupuncture. The man says caffeine gives him a headache, but takes Excedrin like Hunter S. took bluebirds.\n\nNonetheless, the last time the old man swung through, his eyes widened when he saw this place, and we went inside. My dad starting buying things at random, and swears they helped. The staff was very friendly, and this place is so much cooler than GNC.\n\nNext time Pops is in town, I'm sure we'll be right back, buying more new things.","1864506":"First off - the parking lot is a disaster.  Totally filled with unavoidable potholes. I had made an appointment days before so I would not have to wait a ridiculous amount of time as the room is always packed to capacity  After my appointment time came and went for over ten minutes, I politely asked and one staff member rudely advised another that I did not have to be seen until 15 minutes after the scheduled time.  Ok 15 minutes is not all that long but I objected to the rude way in which it was handled.   \n\nHonestly, Quest was definitely better.  I will definitely add some drive time to find another location as this was not the first time this has happened at this location.  Overworked rude front desk staff for the most part and while I have been told I have \"easy veins\" by other lab techs I experienced quite a bit of  pain  when my blood was drawn and my arm is a black and blue mess to top it off.","1868400":"Great selection of teas and herbs. They have just about anything you could want for any condition & the staff is knowledgeable.","1868537":"This review of  9331 Old Bustleton Ave. \n\nI have visited this location twice in the last three weeks. The first time was busy as all else, but I had already made an appointment, then came in early, and was in and out within the hour. \n\nThe second time I was in and out in 15 minutes with no real wait time. The woman who did the bloodwork answered all my questions when necessary and only had to poke me once with the needles--which after having several other people try and draw blood, she was easily one of the most successful on the first attempt. I will be returning in the future until something changes. \n\nPlus the ladies at the front desk are hilarious.","1871430":"This used to be a pretty good place to get lab work, but in the last couple years they have gone down hill. The gaggle of registration people at the front window are RUDE. I tried to ask a couple questions and every response was \"have a seat.\"  I went in for some tests 6 months ago and they failed to enter all the requested tests into their computer system, but actually did some tests NOT requested.  I had to go back again the following month (after my doctor received the incomplete results) to try again. Additionally I had to return a third time to provide yet another sample (insufficient quantity, etc.) Of course they billed my insurance company hundreds of dollars and tried to bill me for THREE co-pays (for each visit.) I finally got through the gauntlet of minions to someone in their management team that seemed to understand the problem and correct my triple billing. I paid my co-pay and thought I was done. Months later I go in for some pre-op testing and the registration clerk kicked me out because she thought I still owed money. I called their billing department and \"everything is straightened out now\" only to go back the following month and get kicked out again. Spend another couple hours on the phone with them and I'm back to square one with the triple billing from 6 months ago! Very frustrating. I ended up paying AGAIN because they threatened to screw up my credit rating. I still feel it is illegal and immoral to extort repeated co-pays when it is their fault that I had to make repeated visits. Maybe that's part of their business plan? The only good news is the phlebotomist that acquired my blood was relatively proficient.","1880848":"This used to be a pretty good place to get lab work, but in the last couple years they have gone down hill.

There must have been 50 people in the waiting room already. There weren't even enough chairs, so people were standing against the walls. I managed to work my way to the electronic check in kiosk, and after 15 minutes managed to grab a chair. After waiting 40 minutes, the receptionist yelled out that people woudl be called back for their blood draws in the order in which they had written their name on a paper sign in sheet. I went to the desk and explained that no one told me about the paper sheet, and that I had been waiting 40 minutes already. The receptionist responded that she had no way of knowing whether what I said was true, and that I should add my name to the bottom of the list. I waited another 45 minutes before I was called back. No one apologized.","1903119":"Terrible place to get blood done. Idk why we have to pay for this kinds blood technician work here. They are so rude and nasty. They are just talk each other and let's patients just sit at waiting room wait and wait for hour and hours. DON'T come here.  And idk why this company hired all this nasty technician work here. I'm sit here waiting. And I see they yell at the elderly. I come here this time is the 3rd times.  I give them a change. But they are still the same Nasty. This company should do something.

I believe this is one of the \"health clinics\" that operate solely on a get insurance money basis and do not care about their patients or performing all necessary steps! Unfortunately this is where I was informed that I had had a missed miscarriage. The doctor told me that it was good that I lost the baby since I'm \"young\" (I'm in my mid 20s) despite me telling her this pregnancy was PLANNED. So incredibly inconsiderate and hurtful to say to someone who had just told you they wanted this baby! On top of that they had no explanation as to why the miscarriage occurred, or even as much as possible reasons if they couldn't specify the exact cause. They did no blood work or urine test and did not refer or recommend any even prior to my diagnosis of missed miscarriage. Upon getting further care at the ER I was told it was because my blood type was rh negative and that if I didn't receive a shot after my miscarriage\/recommended surgery that it would prevent me from ever having a healthy pregnancy in the future! If I had continued the process through this facility I would have never known that, and never been able to have a successful pregnancy! I had also set up an appointment for a regular prenatal checkup and ultrasound over the phone and when I arrived the doctor wasn't even there. She let me know over the phone without even seeing the ultrasound with her own eyes.

Thanks to my friend who used to live in the area, we ran into this little family shop.\n\nI walked in while the shop wasn't very busy. I was told that I needed to do a $10 consultation with the herbal pharmacist. And that the herbs would range from $7-$8.50 depending on the kind of herbs. I agreed and sat down as he felt my pulse and measured my heart beats and consulted with me. The entire process probably took only about 15 minutes. He immediately knew what to mix up for me and started getting my herb treatment packaged up.\n\nHe explained what I needed to do and let me know to see a herb store in my area. When I let him know DC was scarce in that field, he seemed shocked and offered to also do mail orders which I thought was great.\n\nI start my treatment today and can't wait.\n\nIf I am in town again, I intend on returning.","1928867":"Would not take the time with English told me that I need to Google the name and tell her what the name was in Chinese....So I did that person came over to talk to me with her standing there and they act like I was a problem will never come to the store again","1933357":"Annette is wonderfullllll!!!! She took care of me and was fast and efficient. I never met someone as kind as her.","1946286":"This is the absolute worst facility to get your blood drawn.  This place is like the 'McDonalds' of blood testing, but much worse.  The place is always PACKED with people. So I recommend making an appointment. \n\nBut my last visit was the worst. I came in on April 27th. The workers here are all female, and extremely rude and unprofessional.  They enjoy gossiping to each other about work, or checking their phones, than helping the customer.  I literally waiting 20 minutes waiting in patient room 1 so the workers there could figure out what pizza they wanted.  It was absolutely ridiculous.  They spent 20 minutes figuring out which pizza place they wanted to order from. Then they had to call and place the order.  All while I waited in the patient room so they can make sure they get their 'crispy thin crust pizza'.    They treat themselves better than they treat the patients.\n\nNext they always mutilate my arms when I come here.  This last visit was the last straw.  They had to take 30 vials of blood and they pricked my arms 9 times to get it.  My phlebotomists (if they are even phlebotomists, I have no idea, I doubt it) had to call backup because she couldn't figure out how to do it.  Sad!\n\nI will never in my life go to this location ever again.  From waiting in the patient room so they order their pizza, to them mutilating my arms.  They should be ashamed of themselves for their unprofessional behavior and they should all be fired because they obviously care more about themselves, and NOT the patient.  Be warned: when you come here, you are on THERE time.  They aren't on your time.  You aren't a priority.  You are simply cattle to them and they care more about what kind of pizza they are ordering at lunch than doing their jobs!","1949346":"They should call this place \"In-and-Out\" Diagnostics or something!\n\nSo I had to drop by here to get my blood drawn for my doctor's office. I was a little worried about going to Quest Diagnostics because I figured there might be a long wait. The nurse at my doctor's office even said to try to call or book an appointment online before going in because sometimes it can be up to 1-2 hours of a wait if not. \n\nWell I dropped by here at 8:30am... No appointment. I tried calling this place but it just kept ringing and ringing and no one was answering - so I decided to just go. I have a smartphone to keep me busy and all morning with nothing on the schedule. \n\nI showed up at the building. Parking lot looked slammed. Found 1 of 2 open spots. I was bracing myself for the worst. Thinking if it is two or more hours, I'll just come back another time. \n\nI walked in - place has a really small waiting area. Two very nice black ladies greeted me and helped check me in. NO one was there! No one was waiting and looking at the sign-in sheet only a few people signed in before in the morning. \n\nFrom there it was a breeze. It took not even 2 minutes to draw my blood after the lady told me to go to the back room. She found my massive vein and stuck it like a champ. Quick, easy, and painless for me. I don't have a weird thing with needles, I actually prefer to watch. \n\nThen I just left with a nice little gauze over the site they drew blood and I was on my way. 5 stars from me on friendliness, I lucked out on the quick service with no one in front of me waiting, they were professional, and it was done quickly.","1954780":"I didn't think it was possible to get worse than Quest Diagnostics but here you go. The positives are that the waiting room is bright and there is a big screen tv. Those are the ONLY positives.\nI arrived and was completely ignored as I signed in. No hello. Not even a nod. The receptionists was not even busy. They called me back to check in and when I was done they told me to have a seat back out in the waiting room. I asked about the glucose drink and when they wanted to give that to me as I was there for a Glucose Tolerance Test. The girl was very rude. She told me that that's not what the lab work stated and told me to call my doctor. I was on hold with them when they called me back to get my blood drawn. The Labcorp girl told me that if I didn't hang up right away and go back that I was going to lose my appointment. I went back and when I was done called my doctor back from my car. The Medical Assistant confirmed that I was right and they did do the wrong blood work. I went back in and gave the receptionist the phone to talk to my doctor. She was very rude to the Medical Assistant and me arguing with both of us. In the end she was proven wrong when I saw the original slip and it did have the Glucose Tolerance test on it when Labcorp said it didn't. They messed up and got nasty with me and my doctors office and never apologized. I wish my insurance never switched labs because they are rude and ridiculous.","1971205":"This Quest is excellent because of Annette. The plebotomist Annette is professional, pleasant, and knows her job. I have to get my blood tested every month and she is always gentle. Just a real sweet person. Quest should give her a raise because the bosses would be thrilled if all their employees were as good as Annette.","1984961":"What happened to Chestnut Hill Pharmacy??!! Called today and was forwarded to a Rite Aid! I was just there a few days ago and no one said anything to me about closing. Not only is that very rude, they forwarded my personal information to a different pharmacy without notifying me!\n\nChestnut Hill was a great little pharmacy, one of few local pharmacies left. They were great, until the weren't! They should have let their customers know what was going on, as any decent business owner would do. Now the search continues for a new local pharmacy....any ideas?","2005391":"They have everything.  It's great.  Be prepared.  It's dark and gloomy on the dingy side.  But the folks are helpful and friendly.  The products are fairly priced.  Note: credit card charges are $10 or more.","2022594":"This place has one OBGYN on staff and she has evidently tasked herself with the goal of \"saving babies\" from abortion. She saved mine and although I very much love my baby, I do not feel that an OBGYN is trained or licensed to explore these types of sensitive issues with their patients. \n\nThe OBGYN enthusiastically exclaimed that she had \"saved my baby\" when I returned for my 6-week postpartum visit and failed to explore my perceived experience of birth trauma. \n\nWhen I attempted to have my records transferred to a new office for further postpartum care and future regular gyno visits, the office manager solicited my feedback and proceeded to argue with me over several long-winded text messages about how my perspective was unusual and actually, Dr. Geifman is an excellent practitioner who has \"saved many babies from abortion\". She essentially implied that I was simply ungrateful.\n\nI would not recommend this practitioner unless you have decided that you are fully ready to take on the lifestyle and responsibilities of becoming a parent.\n\nDr. Geifman is a highly skilled and compassionate practitioner who is very well-meaning. Unfortunately, I was not satisfied with her care modality from a holistic perspective and I found the office manager to be a bit disorganized and willfully deaf to my concerns.","2023769":"I am a senior, so I made an early morning 6:45 am appointment at 1419 Old York Rd, Abington, PA 19001 for blood work today, August 28, 2020.\n\nA tech entered the room I was assigned to, a room 3, wearing no mask. I asked her why she had no mask on, and asked her to put on her mask. She glared at me and rudely replied \"I just got here. I didn't know anyone was in here.\"  She then put on a mask. I felt extremely upset and unsafe (no way to socially distance in those little rooms). She left the room, then returned and put a face shield over the mask. She asked if I wanted someone else to draw my blood, and I said, \"Yes.\"\n\nOnce the other room, a room 2, was cleared of another  patient, that tech asked me to come in. She apologized when I asked her how such behavior could occur, that no one has ever spoken so rudely to me in any healthcare or medical facility. She said she was sorry, but she didn't hear what was said, so couldn't offer any explanation. \n\nI have filed a complaint with Quest Diagnostics, but in the future I will find another facility where staff are professional and courteous and observe all health and safety guidelines!","2028570":"Annette is the BEST! Ask for her. She was SO KIND, called my doctors office to get clarification, talked to me, and did everything she could to make me feel better (since I hate getting blood taken). She was quick and absolutely the best. Don't go anywhere but here!!","2029531":"Had a 7:30a and 7:45a appt this morning. There were three check-in machines and lots of frustrated people at this location. Labcorp really needs to understand its demographics. Most present were senior citizens, either with reading\/hearing difficulty and or, not computer savvy. Finally a tech came out and helped move the process along. Technology is the way of the future, but dont just throw your most serviced and vulnerable population away!","2042427":"this is a review of grant and boulevard location.  which isn't allowing me to post a review (fishy.)\nhorrible.  employee wouldn't look up my bloodwork order in the system, but claimed she did, right to my face when i could see she hadn't because i was with her the whole time.  but twice repeated she did.  then had to get my doctor's office on the phone and hassle them and have them fax it over.  they said they put it in the system but faxed it too anyway.  so she's not just hassling me, she's hassling my nurse practitioner.  then the employee went on the computer to put it in, and low and behold there was the order that was there all along she allegedly looked up but wasn't there.  at which point she denied she ever said she looked it up.  just crazy.  and then meanwhile two other people had come in who i had to wait for... so 50 minutes later, after initially \narriving with nobody in front of me, finally get my bloodwork.  also she said then she had to destroy the extra order, even though it's repeat bloodwork for thyroid.  so now i have to hassle my doctor again.  it's like they go out of their way to be difficult because it makes them feel powerful.  sad.","2049585":"I love going to Jamestown St. for my tests because Annette is so wonderful to me and everyone who comes thru the door.  She is a great asset to Quest.","2061616":"I had an appointment to get done bloodwork and was in and out . Annette the phlebotomist was amazing . She was so sweet and did her job perfectly . I didn't even realize she was using a straight stick needle ( and not butterfly ) that's how gentle she was . I know now which location I will use for the future . I wish Annette could be at every medical facility , we need more people like her . Thank you","2069349":"Long Life Chinese Natural Herbs is a Chinese apothecary shop much like you will find in most Asian neighborhoods around the globe.  It has both packaged and loose herbs for most known (and many unknown to western culture) ailments.  The owner and employees are quite knowledgeable at understanding your symptoms and making informed suggestions for treatment.  \n\nI observed as several customers described their physical problems, were questioned by the herbalists, and finally reached a thoughtful solution.  Then, the chief lay sheets of clean paper on the counter and began to place various herbs, roots, and barks onto each of them in approximately equal amounts before wrapping each carefully, and placing them in separate bags; one for each dosage - usually a strong tea.  Fascinating!\n\nI was there for fresh, sliced American Ginseng to help stimulate my energy level, and an herbal patch for a friend with Plantar's Fasciitis.  Securing both after enjoying the cultural display rarely seen outside of the Chinatown's of the USA, I left with confidence in my new elixirs.\n\nThis place seems to move substantial volume, and it is a safe bet that their products are fresher than those sometimes found in stores that sell a multitude of other things.","2073310":"Please do not go here. It's unorganized and the front desk is rude. I understand there are restrictions with COVID, but there are no signs posted in the office & when the patients don't follow them they get screamed at to leave and wait in the lobby. \nAlso while it's packed the girls behind the front desk are on their phone not paying attention or talking.","2077941":"After a bad experience 2 days ago which made me pass out and they didn't even get my blood, I was pretty paranoid about trying again. (That was elsewhere btw) I came in to Annette and she was amazing!! 1 poke, and was in and out in 10 minutes... No fainting! I will put her on my Rolodex for next time!","2080172":"Prompt and courteous service. My son was feeling very anxious and needed something natural ASAP to calm him down. The gentleman knew exactly what to recommend and it actually worked!","2082191":"Experience The Healing Power of Mother Earth!\n\nThis past winter (December 2014) I had the flu and then a virus over the course of 6 weeks.  When an infection developed on my tongue turning it yellow and brown, I went back to see my family doctor (my 3rd visit during this 6 week period).\n\nI was told this was a virus and there was nothing to be done but wait it out. I decided to consider alternatives and went to the Long Life herbalist shop.  \n\nThe herbalist asked what was wrong, and I just stuck out my tongue.  He nodded his head, asked a few questions to confirm the symptoms I was experiencing, and then prepared an herbal remedy.\n\nI took my first dose as soon as I got home, and as the warm elixir moved down my throat, my nasal passages and sinuses cleared within 10 minutes! Within 24 hours (after 3 doses) the tongue infection began to clear.  After 3 days, the infection was gone and I was feeling remarkably better then I had for weeks.\n\nWhen I finished the 4 day treatment course, I went back to see the herbalist. I was still weak, wasn't sleeping well, and my stomach was still distressed. He prepared a new herbal remedy, and I began the second course.\n\nI made steady progress, and felt considerably better than I had in over two months! \n\nSince then I have been back three times, each with unbelievable results. My experience with herbal remedies have been remarkably healing. The course of treatment has no side effects like drowsiness or insomnia. The gifts of Mother Earth invigorate, strengthen, and nourish the body.\n\nThe Long Life herbalist shop has earned my five star rating!  Try it!","2130014":"Always a pleasure going to this GNC location. Employees are friendly and always help me find what I'm looking for and thoroughly answer my questions.","2183159":"Parking around this area sucks & it is a longer drive for me, but it definitely beats the downtown Philly office. I just recently moved here so all of my experiences are relatively recent, in about a 2-3 week span. \n\nI prefer this location because the staff are respectful, professional & make you feel so comfortable. Also, you're not here all day like the other location, especially if you make an appointment.","2192984":"Website says that they stay open till 6pm but when I went there at 4pm they were closed. I had tried to call them atleast 20 times since morning but no one picks up the phone. After waiting for a while it goes directly to voicemail. The quest lab which is close to this location picked up their phone immediately... unprofessional service by Labcorp.","2203944":"UPDATE: I did in fact email corporate, who's response was to send me a $15 coupon. Really GNC??? So...after having a bad experience in one of your stores, your solution is to try to get me to spend money in your store??? In the words of Yelp \"methinks not.\" Oh, I plan to use the $15 coupon...for an item that costs EXACTLY $15, lol.","2252836":"People are so nice and friendly. Sure you have to wait, but that's because they give everyone 100% service and help they need. Love itZ","2256213":"I called in to make sure they did the testing I needed and made an online appointment which was extremely easy.  I showed up the next day at 1PM at my scheduled time.  There was about 6 or 7 people in the waiting room. The woman at the counter was clearly disorganized as she was calling out various people's names from her clipboard and the other people waiting were letting her know who she had already seen and had left. It was quickly evident that only ONE person was running this place including doing all of the paperwork and blood draws.\n\nAbout 20 minutes after my appointment time a man who identified himself as a doctor but needed heart surgery that day and needed prompt labwork freaked out because he had been waiting 45 minutes.  The lady keep informing him that she had to take appointments before walk-ins.  Eventually he stormed out to go to another location.\n\nDespite the policy of taking appointments first I was still waiting at 1:30.  Another employee finally came in around this time and she seemed to have a better handle on what to do. She got everyone's paperwork and insurance lined up, but then began taking people in the order they came in, ignoring any appointment times.  This was perhaps fair to those that had been waiting awhile. It took the first lady awhile to figure out my insurance situation, then around 2 or 2:15 they finally got my actual testing going.  I left around 2:30.\n\nSo, despite making an appointment I was there for about an hour and a half to do a small amount of registration paperwork, pee in a cup, and do a 10 second blood draw.  I overheard the first lady complaining that they needed to hire more people for this location. That is likely true, but it also seemed she needed more training herself.\n\nI should have listened to Yelp and gone to the Quest near Methodist which has a couple of good reviews.  I likely would have saved an hour of my time.","2261639":"I popped into this particular location on Sunday night around 6:45pm. Having seen online that they close at 7pm, I didn't want to linger looking for what I needed so I promptly asked the clerk if they carried bentonite clay powder. He said \"no, you're like the second person that's asked that today. Are you using it for a cleanse or do you have something coming up?\" I looked at him quizzically and said \"have something coming up??? I don't understand the question.\" He then asked me if I had \"a drug test coming up?\" I, at this point highly offended, responded, \"I'm using it for cleansing purposes. I don't think that bentonite clay powder would remove the trace of drugs from your system even if I did take drugs which I do not.\" He then replied \"well, some people believe it does and that's why they come in here asking for it.\" What in the WORLD?!?!?! How offensive, rude and disrespectful!!! I would like to know what about me made him think that I am a drug user trying to cleanse my system in preparation for a drug test! I have my suspicions, but...I don't want to impute wrong motives. Even IF, what he says is true, that people use it to remove drugs from their system, when it became obvious that I didn't know what he meant by having \"something coming up,\" the smart thing to do would have been to leave it alone. But he PERSISTED in that line of questioning! I actually use bentonite clay powder to make a wash for my hair and a cleansing mask for my skin, which...is one of the most popular uses of which I am aware. Needless to say, I was HIGHLY offended at his suggestion, have NO intention of returning to GNC for bentonite clay powder or for ANYTHING else and I have EVERY intention of contacting the corporate office to complain!","2295406":"Go to a different location. I've been waiting over 20 min to check in for my appointment. It's not even busy so I'm not sure what's the problem.","2298704":"This place is awful. The staff is rude and don't even acknowledge your existence. A lady who was trying to check in asked a perfectly innocent question to the staff member, and got a blank look of disgust before receiving the staff's response. When I was next in line, the staff pointed to where I should sit - she didn't say anything, just pointed to the seat. Yikes - I can't even describe it well enough. This place is awful and cold.","2320493":"A friendly, knowledgeable staff that will help you find the right product at the right price! They are a family owned franchise, so they are able to compete with surrounding retailers and even some online outlets. They also discount police, fire, and military personnel.  If you are sick of the pushy, agenda driven tactics that GNC is synonymous with, visit the folks at 1100 Columbus blvd GNC and you won't be disappointed!","2323569":"Really GNC? $64.00 for a 180  count bottle of BSN Nitrix? Bodybuilding.com has 360 count bottles for $55.00.

Make sure you find out first their price in their website. I made the deal with one of their stuff compared to Amazon ( well still $2 more expensive ) but the owner is very nice and try to be helpful so I get it anyway. But he got me from getting the other stuff ( I don't want to mentioned the product ) and he charge me double !!! and saying buying 1 and half off for the 2nd one. I know something wrong with the total price, but I was in a hurry. I'm not the person who likes to go back and argue about it. They just going to lost 1 of their customer, I will not go back there anymore. But other than that if you don't mind paying extra money and if you already know the price, you can make a deal with them.","2352978":"This is the best GNC i have ever been to.

This will be the ONLY GNC i go to from now on..... not to mention they gave extra discounts. wonderful experience","2353064":"Had a great experience here today. Sal was refreshingly enthusiastic and knowledgeable. He was the only one working and had a store full of people and handled it well even bringing out samples. Great job Sal!","2362958":"Was not happy with the service at this location. The staff are very cold and rude. They assured us if we made a reservation we would not wait which was important because we were taking our toddler for blood work. Did not matter we waited just like everyone else. I would recommend you go to another location where they are more professional.\n\nJust to follow-up... After the bad experience and waiting almost 1 hour (despite our appointment which was confirmed) their system was down so they were unable to do our tests. \n\nMy opinion of the staff went down and I would say AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COST.","2367503":"I made an appointment at the lab online for 5:15 pm, and on the website, it says that the lab closes at 5:30. When I turn up for my appointment at 5:15, all the lights are off, and it seems everyone has left. I wait around for a while and eventually see someone walking around. I knock, and a receptionist comes to the door, who informs me that the doors close at 5:17 pm (it is 5:18 by the time I've waited and knocked and she's come to the door)! Hard to believe. Most likely everyone simply left early because there was no one waiting. But don't take appointments if you don't intend to honor them, and don't advertise a 5:30 pm closing time if you're going to knock off early when it's quiet!","2368133":"Good service, clean store and products always on sale. \n\nThere's a good variety of brands to choose from.

The woman at the testing site said my labs would be available in 72 hours. Five days later and my doctor and I have not received anything. The Labcorp website is not helpful and there is no number there to contact a human being. I finally call this specific testing site again, it goes to voicemail, and after punching several numbers I finally get an 800 number. I call and after being put on hold for a few minutes (with the worst hold music of all time) the lady picks up and tells me my labs were ready on Tuesday. Why then have my doctor and I not received them? She'll fax them within 10-15 minutes she says. I call my doctor a few hours later. The labs are STILL not there. He has to personally call to get a copy of my labs. The kicker, he also informs me that they do not have a copy of my insurance information meaning the women at the lab site lost it or did not enter it correctly.\n\nLet's rehash. An hour and a half wait even with an appointment. Promise of results in 72 hours. Still no results after 120 hours. Promise to fax my doctor. No fax. Lost insurance information. About 10 calls and hours of my time later just to get a service that should have been performed with ease. This is Comcast level customer service here.","2393155":"After reading some reviews I was scared to come here. I arrived around 8:45am for my 9am appt. There were several people who signed in before me without appointments but right at 9am, I got called in.  Unfortunately, my MD did not submit blood work request like she said she would. I was so afraid that I'd have to leave and set up an appt for another time. \nThe lady was so nice and suggested I give the MDs office a call. After some waiting from the MD office, they finally submitted my lab work request. Labcorp took me right away and I was done in just minutes.","2412060":"Terrible customer service, and the worst Labcorp I have ever been to. The front desk employee was extremely rude from the moment I walked in. Why work a front desk job if you can't be friendly at all?","2421920":"Now I remember why it is best to seek treatment at a world class teaching hospital, than to accept second best from suburban medical providers. They just know more and practice at the highest level of competence and integrity. \n\nSo, when I sought a second opinion before agreeing to a lithotripsy, I scheduled an appointment with Victor Carpiniello, M.D., on the 19th floor of Penn Medicine Washington Square, this week. Impressive offices and even more impressive people there, from reception through Dr. Carpiniello, and everyone in between. There was little wait to see the doctor after completing the standard forms\/questionnaires.  He came into the examination room with a warm smile and years of experience. He knew what I was dealing with and the treatment options. If I wanted, he could take care of the condition later in the week on an outpatient surgical basis. I liked the way he talked to me, and his calm demeanor throughout. \n\nWe agreed to take care of business when suggested, but he wanted me to first have a cardiac clearance as a precaution because of my medical history. That was scheduled for two days later. Turned out, before undergoing general anesthesia for kidney stones, I would need a stress test (which I was due for anyway). That takes place tomorrow. \n\nGiven the unexpected twists and turns this situation has already taken, my decision to seek more information from a higher authority was the right one.  It is difficult to express the increased concern knowing the extra steps that are required to protect my health, while balanced by the sense of confidence and relief I also feel knowing I am in the best hands possible. No knock on my regular urologist who has tended to me for many years, but knowing I am being treated by a leading authority on these conditions; someone who is teaching other doctors how to do these procedures, offers a security blanket that makes going through all this much easier to accept, and sleep at night. \n\nWill update this review as all the steps take place and I come out the other end.","2429181":"Where do I begin? I've only been here twice, and each experience is equally terrible. The first time I came here was during the summer. They got my insurance wrong. Weeks later, I got a bill from Labcorp requesting co-pay for labs that were completed that day. I don't understand how they could've gotten my insurance wrong. Your insurance card and ID are required upon sign-in. And then they make a copy of them when they call you up for your turn. With my insurance I don't pay for labs\/blood work, it's all included in the deductible. \n\nSo I called the billing department of Labcorp and told them that they had the insurance wrong listed on the bill. They checked to make sure that I was not lying to them and placed me on hold to call the insurance company to make sure. So the billing folks said I need not worry about the bill, it was a mistake. That was resolved.\n\nThis time, I went in to drop-off a 24-hour urine sample ordered by doctor. I thought it would be quick and easy, that I would be able to make it to my doctors appointment after. WRONG, it was not easy nor was it quick. It was painfully slow. I was asked to sign in TWICE. Once on the CLIPBOARD and then again at one of their KIOSKS in the waiting room. After signing in, I waited for what felt like eternity. \n\nAs a courtesy, I called my doctor's office telling them I would be late to my infusion appointment. My doctor's office said that I would have to reschedule. Resigned, I said okay, and was given the next available appointment. Like I'm just wondering right now how many people were late or rescheduled their appointments waiting at Labcorp.\n\nLike I can understand that it takes time to draw and run tests on blood and urine samples. But this part? The part of signing in folks, getting their insurance info and ID? It should not take 30+ minutes. I've been to other Labcorp locations, my wait time was less and process was quick and easy. I only went to this location for proximity to my doctor's office and to my appointment.\n\nI kid you not, the person behind the glass window and I made eye contact. I know they see the growing number of people in the waiting room. One lady before me was waiting for a long time, and then went up to the counter and said, \"please cross me off the list, I have somewhere to be and it's just taking too long. Thanks.\" \n\nIs that how you weed out people so you have less people to service? By making them wait for a long time?! Finally, I was called and the drop-off process took 5-7 minutes, compared to my wait time of 40 minutes. I was annoyed. But I got over it because they wasted my time, so I wasn't going to let them waste my mental energy being annoyed with their service.\n\nLabcorp, please work on efficiency and shortening the wait time. People who are getting their lab work done\/dropping off a specimen, be prepared to freaking wait. 2-Stars because: 1) at least the television is on to keep you entertained (insert eye-roll emoji here), 2) maybe if I came in the morning service would have been different, but that's a big IF.","2431262":"I was very pleasantly surprised. I had an 8:15 AM appointment, arrived about 15 minutes early.  My info was taken, got my blood drawn and I was out the door BEFORE 8:15 AM!\n\nAs this was a fasting draw, the fact that it is near about 13,497 different places to eat breakfast afterwards was a plus.  Hehehe, at that point I could have eaten a horse.\n\nEvery single person I encountered was super nice, friendly, chatty, even funny!","2432028":"No professional or near pleasant experience, front desk has 0 to no respect yet demands it's , feels like service from a ghetto chuck E Cheese. Terrible terrible terrible and they are talking about better jobs, Professional jokesters more like. I don't know why a hospital is ran like a pig pen but I'm sure that should be marked as a HUGE RED FLAG, immature staffs at a HOSPITAL is a death waiting to happen","2445474":"I have never made an appointment with them. I always just walk in. Usually it's only 1 or 2 other people there. What I have noticed over the years is that they've down graded the amount of staff. A lot of businesses are doing this and it hurts customer service. Today I noticed they have a check in kiosk and only 2 people working. These 2 people answer phone calls, do lab work and help patient who don't know how to use the kiosk check in. Overall the process was fast from check in to blood draw it took 15 minutes, but I can only image if they were packed what it would of been.","2445946":"Everyone was super nice here. I made an appointment rough MyPennMedicine portal and they were able to get me an appointment within two weeks, which is almost impossible at good healthcare providers like Penn. I went to see Dr. Woods who was extremely nice, non judgmental, and very informative. They offer walk in hours which is almost unheard of with Primary Care doctors. \n\nThe facility was extremely clean, the view from the 17th floor is beautiful, I could sit there all day.\n\nI'm glad I have decided to make this my go to office for routine check ups.","2452985":"Amazing and extremely helpful.\n\nI used to go to the PP location on Chestnut before it closed up. I finally started looking at the other PP locations in the city a while ago and ended up choosing this one. I'm relieved that I did.\n\nMy first appointment at the center on Castor Ave was earlier today. I was beyond anxious, but ended up leaving with a very pleasant experience. I was treated with nothing but respect, I got the service I needed, and I was offered LOADS of really helpful advice and information.\n\nEveryone was awesome. I seriously did not encounter even one staff member who was anything less than respectful and nice. I simply can not emphasize enough just how helpful and respectful everyone was from start to finish.\n\nThe entire office was squeaky clean minus one clogged toilet, but that happens everywhere.\n\nAlso, since I know that this can be difficult in many medical offices, everyone I met here continued to treat me with the utmost respect even after reviewing my entire history- including my eating disorder. Super understanding and a lot of foresight + insight from one of the ladies in particular. My anxieties over the appointment at a new location vanished the more she spoke. She was supervising and I don't remember her name, but she was wonderful. Just awesome through and through.\n\n---\n\nSince I looked at reviews all over the web before my appt, I thought I should say I didn't find the wait time to be excessive. I thought I was called back pretty quickly (15 min?), but today was my first appointment at this center so I can't say if this is always the case. I know that wait times can be absurdly long at some PP locations, so we'll see what happens next time.\n\nI also make my appointments with PP online, so I can't comment on what might be going on with phone calls.","2453016":"The technician did not close the privacy curtain while drawing blood from other patients (there were four of us waiting to get blood drawn at the same time, with several others waiting close behind). The waiting room was a mess, people were openly speaking on their cell phones, eating fast food. The facility itself was gross - there were flies hovering around and the sharps containers in the booths were VERY full. If I didn't have to use Labcorp, I wouldn't.","2469900":"The appointment started at the time I have chosen; however, the whole experience was not pleasant. I often faint when my blood is drawn and I warned a nurse it could happen. She did not make any precautions and indeed I fainted 1 minute after the procedure. They brought me ice bags really quickly but still kept doing the measurements, such as taking my blood pressure immediately after I fainted while it obviously would be different under the normal circumstances. My blood pressure was extremely low 96\/40 however, when I received my results it said 196\/40 :O I have a history of low blood pressure and with fainting it was even lower, so they made an error when reporting the results. The worst is when I called them to talk about this error they were very rude and put me on hold. I waited for several minutes and they never got back to me. Moreover, while drawing my blood they pinched my vein, so that 10 days after the blood was drawn I still have pretty sever bruising on my arm. I do not recommend this place to anyone.","2475902":"I had a bill with a due date of 12\/19\/19, I called on 12\/19\/19 to pay the bill, and the rep told me they sent it in for collections on 12\/13\/19. I've had issues with Penn med in the past, and will no longer be using them. Zero accountability, horrible customer service.","2488101":"I lived in London under the British Socialized Medical system and I was able to get both appointments scheduled and get callbacks back from doctors after tests in a much more timely fashion. \nThe other day I was at another part of the Penn System, Penn Pain Medicine because I was having extreme back pain. It took\nme 6 weeks to get an appointment even after telling the staff member I was in extreme, debilitating pain. \nAfter seeing the Dr, who I believe to be excellent, he told me to make an appointment for six weeks out. I walked out of the exam room to the reception desk to schedule the next exam.  I was told that 7 weeks was the earliest appointment!\nSomething is wrong with the entire Penn system if people in extreme pain can't be seen for six weeks and it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to get ones Dr to call you with the results of tests and what they mean. \nPenn is broken. Penn medicine seems to have great doctors with horrendous horrendous system problems.","2489841":"I came here for a couple followup appointments from a recent surgery and I had a great experience with Dr Oren Friedman and the Penn Medicine staff. I give 5 stars because of the expertise of Dr Friedman. \n\nOn the 18th floor, the waiting room is nice, the staff is friendly and the rooms are clean and organized. \n\nYou can park in the attached garage and receive discounted (not free) parking - new to get it validated at the front desk. There is also some (limited) street parking nearby.","2509221":"This establishment should not be allowed to call themselves a medical facility and provide any care to patients. I came here for a COVID test and the whole experience was a disaster. The receptionist was rude to every patient there. I had to wait 45 minutes for the test, with several other patients in the same room, when I had a scheduled appointment. I filled out a form with all my information such as height\/weight, medical history, etc. When I received the test I got a form back with the results and all my personal information was wrong, including the height\/weight and other personal information. I started to question whether these were even my results or if they were someone else's, but I didn't say anything because I felt like I would get COVID from being in there for too long due to the amount of people in there. They also charged my card $85 as a deposit because they could not figure out the insurance. This amount was supposed to be refunded but every time I call, the \"billing specialist\" is not in. They gave me the \"billing specialists\" email, which was of no help because I am now being ignored. Just save your time and money and go to a legitimate urgent care or testing center.","2510946":"I have always hate good experiences, until this one time when they attempted to double bill my insurer. Of course, the insurer rejected the second billing. That's fraud. Instead, Labcorp sent me the several thousand dollar bill claiming my insurer said I had other coverage I needed to use instead. This was a lie. I had to call my insurer to clear it up and they had to send Labcorp a list of what my benefits cover, even though I have been a customer of theirs and do bi-yearly labwork! \n\nPlease be EXTRA careful. Companies like this are a prime reason why we need universal healthcare and pre-existing conditions should be covered. It is too easy to fall through the cracks and have a big company like this take advantage of you. \n\nI was lucky my insurer advocated on my behalf.","2514821":"They don't support military insurance so that means they don't support the troops over seas and all veterans and AD please shame this place till they change that policy.","2520279":"This place is gawd awful.  Let me count the ways...\nFront desk person was rude.  \nWhen I went back to get my blood taken I overheard a little lady complaining that it was too cold to which an extremely rotund employee laughed her ass off saying it was too hot.    \nWhen was time for me to get my blood taken, the chick shows up, doesn't introduce herself and immediately starts putting the rubber band around my arm.  Like WTF?  I have needle apprehension (aka I puke when I see needles).  I told her she needed to let me know when she was bringing it out so I could look away and she goes \" It doesn't bother me\".  Umm it's not about you.  I'm the one with needle apprehension.    The whole vibe was just beat.  If you had to choose between Labcorp and a random warm body on the street.  I'd go with the warm body.","2520840":"Great customer service very friendly and well educated about their products highly recommended","2555750":"A quick and easy rapid covid test! very clean and organized, highly recommend stopping here for testing needs!","2590231":"Don't be scared to come here, just be prepared to wait even if you have an appointment. They are severely understaffed. I arrived 2 minutes before my appointment this morning (which was the first open of the day) and already noticed about 20 other people waiting in the sitting area. \n\nYou have to sign in, and i noticed i was the only person with an appt on the sign-in sheet while everyone else who was there was walk-ins. \n\nFor some reason, those who were walk-ins were given priority and were headed to the back to do their lab work first. I ended up waiting 30 minutes before I was seen despite having a confirmed appointment. This was the biggest frustration. You're better off just walking in if you are planning ahead. \n\nApart from that, the 2 employees working there were wonderful. They were clearly short staffed but kept a positive and upbeat attitude and were clearly used to working this understaffed. They tried their best to move as fast as they could whilst making those getting bloodwork done feel comfortable.","2596445":"This is probably the least professional staff I've ever encountered and I didn't even make it back to get my work done.  I arrived and filled out my information at the kiosk and was quickly called up and told \"they have nothing for me\".  I told the woman I had no idea what that meant and asked if she could elaborate and give me direction as to how to proceed in order to get my work done.  (Penn sent me over as a walk in, I had never been there before and was unsure of the procedures).  I was experiencing a possible miscarriage and on top of that stress did not appreciate being treated as a problem just being in the building.  This woman couldn't have expressed less interest in helping me  or more attitude. I called my doctor who was supposed to fax over the paperwork and showed back up an hour later.  Within minutes of me sitting they were aggressively turning patients away saying they were closing.  I got called back and apparently my paperwork did not come through.  I asked for a moment to call my doctor back and was told they were closing in 4 minutes and there was no time even though there were several others still waiting who arrived after I did.  While I was sitting there the staff complained audibly about the number of patients and how done they were for the day.  If this review saves one person a horrible experience on top of an already horrible day then that is good enough for me.  I'm still flabbergasted that people who behave like this are able to hold jobs.  I have three jobs in the service industry so I know it can be tough to deal with some people but you don't have to be cold and miserable to everyone for no reason.  ESPECIALLY in a setting where you are dealing with patients who are very ill or experiencing trauma.","2599365":"The wait time in the one in Yeadon is an atrocity. I had prechecked online but that means nothing. I have had to wait because there is one person checking in and drawing the blood. And 3 of us had been booked for the same time 7:15am. So here i am,still waiting! How is it even safe for one person to both check in and draw blood? Doesn't the state have some requirement for at least 2? What if there is a medical emergency? I know I'm never coming back here! For the record,I'm still waiting.......","2611019":"A long one: The only good thing to say about this location is that they are open until 6pm. I arrived at 4:45PM on a Friday with no one waiting. When I was called back about 10 min later there were maybe 5 people that had come in since I had arrived. \n\nWhen I got to the check-in desk I showed my paperwork, to which the female working looked at me and asked \"are you serious with all these tests?\" (I think I had 8 ordered). I looked at the clock and then back at her and asked if they were suddenly closing early? She ignored me. Pretty sure she wasn't going to be happy there were other customers after me. I looked down and noticed her iphone was on. I asked if she was on the phone, she ignored me. It quickly became clear that she had earbuds on under her scarf and was on a personal call! I didn't push it because she was ignoring me anyway and none of my personal medical information was being verbalized. \n\nI got my blood work drawn with no problem and left. I got a call from my doctor a few days later wondering why I didn't get all the tests she had requested? I said that I had handed in all the orders. About a week later the missing test results magically showed up in the labcorp system. My doctor called to ask me if I had gone back to get the additional test ... I had not! So it was clear they had misplaced my paperwork. What a mess. \n\nSide note: just out of curiosity I looked up this location on Instagram to see what was on there. It's basically just all selfies of the women who checked me in. So unprofessional.","2618276":"Please do not ever go to this urgent care! \n\nMy sisters and I scheduled 3 separate appointments for COVID testing. We arrived 10 mins early, we completed the online check-in prior to our arrival to avoid any issues. My sisters went in first to let them know that we were here. To start, the women at the front desk kept telling them that they did not accept walk-ins, even after my sisters told them they had an appointment multiple times. After they finally took the time to listen, they instructed my sisters to fill put some forms and to give them their insurance cards & Photo ID. I came in with my child, who had his mask on and sat down to wait to be called. A woman sitting down the hall was coughing and the front desk woman comes out to my sisters and I to tell us that we can not be seen because we were coughing. She repeatedly told us we could not be seen until I pointed out to her that it was someone else coughing. That we did not have symptoms. She then proceeded to tell me to \"take my son somewhere\". When I explained to her that I would wait in the car until they were ready, she continues tell me to take him out but I'm his parent, it's my choice? Right.\n\nAfter I told her that we would wait outside, keep in mind, we've already waited an hour past our scheduled appointment time, she rushed us out the door.\n\nMy sister received a call, she didn't answer in time so we call back and they act as if they have no idea what we're talking about and who we are so I told my sister to go inside and wait so that they know we are still here.\n\n2 hours of waiting, they hand my sister her ID and insurance card to tell her they ran out of kits. BULLSHIT.\n\nI called a different number to try and figure out what was going on and she acted as if she had no idea what was going either but told me she would call me back... but didn't ask for my number to call back?\n\nPoint of this story,\nThey're unorganized, rude and liars.","2639869":"By now I don't really expect anything to go smoothly in Philly... first off I had trouble finding parking, but this was at 7am... doesn't anybody go to work or anything anymore? I get there at 7 opening time... place was dark, then I thought what's wrong now? Then a woman shows up at 7:04 and opened the place... I guess they were late. One plus was that it wasn't crowded as I expected it to be, as most of these places are early. Apparently the person was running the whole place themselves because there were no other staff there at that time. So she was at the front desk but then she also took people in the back and drew blood. Another downside was I don't know if she hit the wrong thing on my arm but no blood came out and she had to try the other arm, later on the other area was purple so maybe the wrong thing was hit. Anyway as long as my samples come back soon I'll be satisfied.","2641991":"Lost an important sample of mine and now because of it I had to be subjected to a subsequent blood test (which is less reliable than the original method of sampling) but because I've been on doctor prescribed medication in the meantime, there is a large probability that the original type of sample will come out as a false negative. Extremely unhappy with the lack of care and professionalism that has been exhibited since I had informed them I never received the results of my sample. Gross incompetence, negligence and then followed up by complete apathy. If they don't care to run an important lab like this properly then they should shut it down and leave their other facilities as options.","2645199":"omg what a mess. crowded, slow and barely friendly. very impersonal setting. they need a better setup, quicker staff. I had a much better, faster experience at Quest Diagnostics.","2647910":"WORST FACILITY EVER.\nWorst customer service. They cannot be bothered to even make eye contact - the woman behind the counter shouts at you, is rude, dismissive and completely unhelpful. Not to mention their operation hours list them until 11PM on Saturday with afternoon hour appointments, only to arrive at 10:30AM for blood work that takes an hour and to be told they close at 11AM and to leave. \"They don't have time for this\" - even though their appointment hours are wrong.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE. Find another facility!!!","2655853":"I scheduled an appointment via the online site and it was 1 hour after my scheduled time before I was seen. The policy in the confirmation clearly states you will be seen as close to your appointment time as possible, yet they took multiple walk ins prior to me. When I politely asked, the lady at the front said I was late and therefore she was going to take everyone in front of me. There is literally 0 policy info regarding being a min or two late and losing your appointment as though you never scheduled it - in fact, the policy says the opposite in the confirmation email I received.  The lady said she was the only person here and had to do 3 jobs as 1 person because of this.  She also gave extremely misleading time estimates to people when they asked (telling everyone 20 mins when clearly 5+ people had to go and it was taking 10-15 mins per person).  Not the first place I'd go for testing if I had a choice.\n\nUpdate: the lady did a quick and pleasant job with the blood sampling, so up to 2 stars.","2665262":"My experience has been nothing but great!!! All staff has been super helpful, kind, and down to earth. I honestly can't thank them enough for all their help above and beyond!","2675550":"I have to admit that when I first arrived I felt regret that I didn't schedule my blood work with Jefferson. I felt a slight attitude all around and the energy in the waiting room was one of agitation.\n\nThat said, when it was time to have my blood work done, the technician put me at ease regarding the process. It may simply be that the cast of characters that come and go in waiting rooms can eventually exhaust the staff but what I appreciate is that when the actual moment arrived to have my blood taken, the compassion was there. I was able to express my anxiety and the technician offered me really genuine advice.","2697679":"No one likes having their blood drawn (unless you're some kind of masochist), but I had a positive experience at this location. It's one of the only Labcorp offices in the city that's open on Saturday, so I didn't have to take any time off from work to come here. I came right at 7 AM and the wait was not long at all. The employees weren't the friendliest, but they weren't awful either, so it is what it is. Please note that my script was for routine blood work; if you require pre-employment drug screen collection or other specialized testing, I do not believe they do that here.","2703599":"The receptionist at this office is very rude. The receptionist tells me when I arrive for my appointment that I could not bring my children in the back with me to get a depo shot when I have brought them many times before. I could not get my shot and this is how women get pregnant. The people who work for planned parenthood make you reschedule your appointments which is not good for women on a schedule taking birth control. Planned parenthood gets a lot of patients who are most likely low income or can't afford healthcare and may have children and no help. These people may not have support from others. So who does planned parenthood think is going to watch these people's children while they get health services?? Also, if their policy about women bring their kids to the clinic have changed then women should be told this when they are making an appointment, not when they show up for the appointment with their kids!","2707558":"The front desk was so agitated and rude.  Like they are extremely bothered you are there.  Then when I got my blood work the phlebotomist was nice but she was extremely rushed and either hit an artery or pulled out the needle from my vein the wrong way bc it was extremely painful and I immediately developed a hematoma in my antecubital area.","2708327":"This LabCorp location is one I frequent when I need lab tests!  I like to b ore-register online so when I arrive...I check in with my mobile phone at the kiosk!\n\nThe staff are busy..usually distracted..but the move everyone along quickly!  \n\nThe lab technicians are skilled in what they do..but it would be nice if they were more consistent with how they treat patients","2711850":"How long does it take to draw a blood sample?? An hour or more apparently. Maybe one single person working here, it's self check in and one person I assume is drawing blood. It's not like this is a free service - we all pay ridiculous $$ either out of pocket or insurance. Do better, please.  If I could go to Quest Diagnostics, I would.","2713885":"Who likes to get their blood drawn.. Just like most healthcare facilities, there's a bit of a wait. Not too bad. I waited about 15-20mins before being called for registration. Then their computer system was acting up which took longer. I didn't mind waiting, as long as the information gets into the system correctly. That's all that matters to me. \n\nThey are running on a new system. If they see that you have a balance on your account, you are required to pay it prior to getting another test done. At least that was what the person at the registration desk told me. I had bloodwork done last month, and recently got the bill. I told her I sent the payment in. But without a confirmation number or proof that I paid, I will not be able to get this bloodwork done today. I'm here. I fasted. I wasn't going to reschedule. So I have to call my bank, cancel the check that I mailed in and pay her with my credit card in order to proceed. Not too crazy about this process, because who normally has the money right there and available to pay a bill? But it is what it is I guess.\n\nMy phlebotomist was great! I can't recall how many times I told her that she was amazing! I didn't feel her start the line, didn't feel her changing the eight tubes of blood that i needed to take. Didn't even know she was finished until she said to please apply pressure on the gauze. I was amazed! Should've taken her name down, and ask for again upon my next visit!!!!","2723173":"I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes at this location nor have a ever made an appointment. The entire  process beginning with check-in is as simple as it should be.","2727593":"I've been in the Penn care network all my life and they have never disappointed-- my experiences have always been outstanding. The staff members are friendly, patient, and caring. Not to mention, the view at this particular location overlooking center city on the 18th floor is quite pretty. As a new patient I saw Dr. Steven Chesnick who did an excellent job helping with my hearing problem and I couldn't be more grateful. \n\nThe one complaint that comes to mind is that it can be very difficult to schedule with speciality doctors, as they are booked months in advance.","2730501":"Horrible. I ran out of birth control, called the 215 number to schedule an appointment, there is just a voicemail. Nobody even bothers to answer the phone anymore. Drove over there to make an appointment in person like I always do. Nobody responded when I went to the front door. Walked around side door & the woman refused to make an appointment for me. I explained that I had no more birth control & this was urgent. Her response was \"oh well you have to leave a message & we'll call you back\". What if you miss the call? It's ridiculous. I understand that places have changed policy during COVID-19 but places like these should be ashamed. They get paid to do nothing. I could hear the ladies inside laughing & chatting it up, but they refuse to help a customer or even schedule an appointment. Why isn't anyone answering the phone??? Literally what else do they have to do there since obviously they no longer are accepting walk ins. Luckily I was able to do CVS minute clinic so to anyone who needs BC I suggest trying them. I happened to go at a great time, no wait whatsoever so I lucked out. The nurse wrote my BC script & I got it filled there too. Thank God some people are still out here actually working. Planned Parenthood Castor Ave y'all should be ashamed of yourselves. None of you deserve paychecks. All you do is sit inside a locked building, don't answer the phone, don't let people in & refuse to help people. You all should be ashamed.","2736730":"So freaking rude for no reason at all ladies here seem miserable and always have an attitude","2741086":"Scheduled a COVID-19 test online -- which was super convenient and had a ton of availabilities. \n\nThe door to the clinic is hard to locate, the staff are shorthanded so it took a long time for anyone to pick up the phone, and they never gave me an invoice to submit to my health insurance to cover the test. \n\nThe actual test was quickly delivered with a knowledgeable medical professional. \n\nThe rest of the clinic's management seems too chaotic. I will not be returning unless this is the only place available.","2742389":"It is literally 100 degrees outside today. You have a guy standing outside in direct sun holding a sale sign.

He did not tie the tourniquet tight enough so he could not find my veins (veins which are very easy to spot).  He punctured the most lateral part of my arm and inappropriately wiggled the needle around. Of course this horrible technique did not work so he then had to puncture me again and continued to wiggle the needle, causing pain. This is not the correct way to withdraw blood and he needs to be trained properly. I have had no problems with my blood being drawn in the past but this man was clearly inexperienced and needs to learn his job.","2800178":"I stopped in this gnc after being scammed by the pep boys next door for a snack.

I think it's great I get my merc really fast in a day or so. So it's no need to go down there for my purchases","2881062":"This place was clean and relatively comfortable. The staff were kind, efficient and helpful, and I had no trouble making an appointment online. On a Monday morning, it wasn't too busy to just drop in, either. The phlebotomist was very professional and nice and didn't make fun of me for being a wuss about getting blood drawn.\n\nI would give this office more stars, but it's hard to say I'm a fan of anything involving needles and peeing in a cup.","2882572":"Whatever you do, schedule an appointment. If not, you will be waiting there for half an hour guaranteed. I'm a student at Hahnemann Hospital and all of my physicians are affiliated with Drexel, so this is very convenient when a doctor orders blood work. That is the biggest factor in keeping me here. The environment is clean but certainly not endearing, and the staff will rush you in and out, but when you notice the line, I don't blame then. The tests are done accurately and reported to the prescriber in a timely manner. I don't know what else you would want in a lab.","2904414":"Every once in a while I'll go all hippy-dippy and decide that I'm into herbs instead of modern medicine. When I do, this is home base for herbs. Can't sleep? Do your feet itch? Does your breath stink? Stop your whining and get your butt over there. They will have what you need. You will get no weirdness and nobody will try to douse you in pachouli (unless you want to, I suppose). \n\nI am far from being practically perfect in every way, and I'm sure I'll be back on line at Walgreens soon, but for now, I'm going au natural with my herbs. Oh yeah...","2913325":"I come here every day before work to grab a bottle of water and some snacks. If I need anything else, like vitamins or whatever, the staff is always extremely helpful and informative. Sometimes it feels like they're asking you personal questions (example: I asked them where I could find iron supplements, and he asked me if I was anemic) but that's just because they're trying to make sure you're getting exactly what you need. They also have public bathrooms, but you do need an access code.","2921418":"I have been to a number of Quest Diagnostics in my day and have never experienced anything this bad. I chose this location because of the convenience to my office and made an appt for my lunch break. I waited 1.5 hours WITH AN APPOINTMENT. They were slow and understaffed. They didn't even have anyone at the front desk to sign people in. People were complaining and walking out while I continued to wait. When I finally said something (after 1.5 hours) the response I received was a shrug and \"lots of people have to wait\". I will NEVER go back to this location.","2922431":"I may have been lucky but I was in and out in 9 minutes. \n\nThe staff may be overworked but they were pleasant and professional. \n\nI picture many of the negative reviews can be attributed to resenting the business model of outsourced lab work.","2925902":"Great addition to Northern liberties. At first I thought this was going to be an expensive herbal remedies store. And while they do have plenty of herbs, I've found it to be surprisingly affordable for the brands and products they carry. Their large packaged herbs are actually a very great price. We actually end up getting a lot of produce from here as they have a wide affordable selection and their location is so close to the subway.","2929901":"After reading a lot of previous reviews, I was nervous coming into this office. But the experience totally wowed me.\n\nNo wait time as I came in around 1:30 pm in the afternoon. After the nurse checked me in, I was able to have me specimen collected immediately. And checked out within 20 mins.\n\nThere was only one nurse in the office. But not so many patients and therefore I did not have to wait. I did not even book an appointment.\n\nThe place is also very clean and bright. There were two bathrooms. Very clean.\n\nNurse was friendly and quick.\n\nI am definitely amazed by this experience and felt based on my own experience here today. The preview comments don't justify how quick and great of the service I have experienced here.","2931695":"The people who staff this medical center hate their jobs and it shows but as long as we as a society get more and more sick, they will keep their miserable jobs with little to no competition. \n\nIt's different when the fast food worker screws up your burger or when the kid at the grocery store smashes your bread but we are dealing with the same level of competency while dealing with life and death issues such as health care.  \n\nThe Post Office, H&R Block and Quest Diagnostics could have a competition to see who are the laziest bunch of jerks.","2937187":"Love the variety and pricing of the food. Just beware of their business hours.  When they say they close at 630, they mean they start locking the door 15 min before then. And they mean it, so don't be surprised if they don't act that happy to see you coming in shortly after 6...","2939543":"WOW! This is an amazing resource! Their CS Reps are super helpful friendly.  I  had to return a product, and they issued a refund quickly no problem at all. Their Natures Wonderland brand is about the best price I have found if you are looking for quality and price which we all are I think.  The Herbal Extracts are fresh well packaged & as I already said a GREAT price. Oh and they have a great assortment of soaps, and lotions, and some snack mixes too! The Athletes mix has the worlds biggest freshest raisins!  Yummy!  This place is money WELL SPENT! I have been to their store & ordered on line both great.","2955511":"Thought this place was pretty skeevy when I first walked in and sat in the main waiting room -- just kind of dim and depressing. But actually it was fine. The people working here were quick and efficient, and although not extraordinarily personable they got me in and out quite rapidly even though I was just a walk-in. And I could barely even feel the needle stick for the blood draw, which is of course a big plus.","2959044":"Penn Herb Company is now back at 2nd and Spring Garden in their gorgeous brand new building. Have been shopping there at least 30 years and am so very glad they are back in the neighborhood. Excellent customer service, fair prices, vast inventory. As good as it gets!","2964988":"Inez was super helpful and professional. She was only worker there juggling the patients and myself as a walk in. She got me in and out and managed to work around the out of order plumbing while assisting everyone. I would recommend coming to this location for any services they offer.","2966051":"They allow pet dogs (as well as service dogs of course) into this grocery store. How exciting!\nI love this store and their new building is fantastic! \n\nI shopped there MANY times and the customer service is OUTSTANDING. They seem to only hire well-versed staff, which keeps me coming back.  They also carry high quality herbs, foods, snacks, groceries, books and bamboo fiber socks!   This is the only shop in Philadelphia where I have been able to find bamboo fiber socks.  My toenail fungus problem has become less severe ever since I switched to wearing them.\n\nI really do wish that they would carry beeswax candles as well as cosmetics such as hemp organics lipstick and 'No Miss' nail polish.","2966759":"It was completely by accident that I stumbled upon Penn Herb Company. At first I wasn't even going to go in, but my bf convinced me to just check it out and see what they had. \n\nI admittedly do not believe in alternative medicine - I don't dis-believe in it, but I'm not about to choose it over my local pharmacy - so at first I was just wandering around the large front room, curious to see what types of herbs were listed under the different categories (the sexual health section being the most fun when \"just browsing.\"). But then I wandered into the second, smaller room and found what I was looking for.\n\nThey have a few shelves that are dedicated to bulk herbs. BULK. The prices are pretty nice, everything is listed alphabetically so its easy to find, and they list the medicinal uses for each herb on the label. But amongst all those herbs are tons that you use just for everyday cooking, and typical drinking teas too! Next thing I knew I was cradling tons of bags like a baby - it was hard to whittle down the choices to those I actually needed (versus those I just want so I can say I have them). And the staff is so nice and friendly and helpful! They're really sweet people, I'll go back just to make sure they get my business, even though they're....not exactly anywhere near my neighborhood. If you're into alternative medicine, this is definitely the place for you, but even if you don't you will find something that you want anyway!","2972011":"Please do not buy things if you know not what they do.  I usually come in to buy the healing herbs for my life here...FYI allergy sufferers-there is a liquid form of Butterbur that Penn Herb carries.  I dare say it will alleviate if not eliminate your allergies! Achoo!!","2974933":"The staff at this lab is an absolute disgrace. I am confused as to how they are even able to keep a job with there inability to be able to speak and interact with the public. They were no help at all. The ignorant girl at the front desk ripped my slip out of my hand and told me \"they don't do this test here\" and threw it back at me. No hello. How are you? And no help when I asked where I have to go. They are ignorant and rude. I wouldn't go back here if my life depended on it. Management there needs to teach there staff customer service skills or get a whole new staff. What a disgrace.","2995096":"I really love this new addition to the neighborhood. The store is beautiful inside. \n\nThere are a ton of herbs and vitamins to choose from and you can learn a lot from the employees (Most of them). \n\nI wish they had a bigger selection of organic\/ healthy foods but besides that I love this place.","2999458":"DO NOT GO HERE Very poor service. I went in with an appointment that was made online. The lady in a silver hat insisted I didn't have one. I had to call my insurance company. It turns out my name was spelled wrong in the system. No apologies were made by silver hat lady. She mumbled, didn't explain what she was doing, didn't make eye contact, was combative and unprofessional. At one point I thought I was going to have to ask her to change from the gloves she was wearing at the computer, into a new pair to take my blood, but she switched at the last moment only after taking my blood pressure and weight. Not when she entered the room. I highlight doubt any vitals taken were accurate. I was so upset during the process, I nearly left. Great for blood pressure tests! I will not go back to this location.","2999679":"I discovered Penn Herb Company at their first location in the Northeast and was so excited when I found out they were opening a spot closer to me! I can guarantee I'll find whole-food-based vitamins, which I always like but was essential for me when looking for prenatal vitamins. They also have a wide variety of foodstuffs and other products, which is impressive considering their relatively small space. Plus, there are ALWAYS staff nearby to ask questions too.","3005591":"This would be a 5 star rating it I hadn't wasted 40 minutes driving around looking for a store that literally no longer exists. The N. 2nd St. address listed here and on their elaborate website is incorrect. Not only has the store moved, the physical building it used to be in has apparently been torn down-- which leads me to believe this move happened quite some time ago and nobody has taken the time to, I dunno, tell potential customers? According to a very small notice on their website they will be reopening this store in 2013.\n\nThe new (temporary?) store, some 15 miles away is well stocked and the workers are quite friendly and helpful. I was looking for some fairly obscure herbs and essential oils and they had them all for a very fair price. Unfortunately, this location is not likely to get much business because a) the only place you can see the new address is on a sign posted on the fence that surrounds the large hole in the ground where the old store used to be, and b) there is zero lighting and minimal signage around the new store that is located in what seems to be in some sort of industrial complex. \n\nEither way, the positive experience I had once I got over how pissed I was has forced me to consider making this my go-to spot for my herbal needs\/natural product needs.\n\nFYI the ACTUAL (current) address is 10601 Decatur Road\nPhiladelphia, PA 19154","3005673":"Having needed to get my blood drawn five times in the past eight months, I've become something of a Quest connoisseur.  \n\nTwice I've gotten my blood drawn at this particular location, and twice I've left with blood soaking through the band-aid and dripping down my arm.  This happened with two different phlebotomists, but had never happened before (and hasn't happened since) - so I'm pretty sure the problem was their training, and not my arm.  \n\nNot as big a deal, but still annoying - most staff members were rude, and seemed as if they absolutely hated their jobs.  None of them made eye contact with me (or any of the other patients, for that matter), even when giving directions or engaged in a conversation.\n\nTwo stars because some of my blood actually did end up in the vial, and I got the results within a week - so they must have done ok on the paperwork end.\n\n(The Quest on South Broad is much better in terms of friendliness, professionalism, and lack of a bloody arm.)","3020458":"Weird thing for a tattooed gal such as myself to admit, but I'm a little scared of needles. Not tattoo needles, obviously, but getting shots & having blood drawn are not my favorite.\n\nSo I had a terrible experience last week with an attempt at getting blood drawn. They blamed the needles, they blamed me for not drinking enough water (BS). When they tried the left arm: \"Nothing is coming out.\" When they tried the right arm: \"Why's it so slow? That's going to leave a bruise!\" So I made them stop because I was kind of freaking out, & I left in tears. But I still needed the bloodwork.\n\nToday, I went to Quest Diagnostics...you know, the place that SPECIALIZES in drawing blood. Not only were they nice to me, but the procedure was quick, painless, & left no bruise. I was in & out of that place in 5 minutes & should have my results within a week.\n\nOh & I asked if not drinking enough water is ever a problem in drawing blood, & they told me that I'd have to be pretty damn dehydrated for that to be a factor.\n\nI won't allow anyone else to do my bloodwork again.","3032847":"The Penn Herb Co is a family-owned business that has very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I was dying to go in here, but they close at 5:30--before I get off work.  On my day off I stopped in and came home with 2 different reasonably priced teas.  \n\nThe atmosphere is so friendly, I want to go back just to say hi.","3037259":"i definitely was appalled by the other people waiting in the waiting area, however that is not the establishment's fault. in fact, one of the people working there (not sure if she was a nurse, or blood tech, or whatever) attempted to get two unruly kids to settle down and stop running around, while their aunt was getting blood drawn. the whole situation was crazy, but i give her credit for trying to make some semblance of order.\n\nthe waiting room was definitely not well kept. my appt was for 3:45 and i arrived 10 minutes early, in case they would take me sooner. they didn't take me before my appt but it was quick and painless. my tech drew blood and was nice but not overly friendly.\n\nif i could avoid going here again in the future, i would.","3055786":"Penn Herb Co. has a HUGE selection of healthy living items. The staff is super friendly and I've found them to be very knowledgeable. Check it out!","3067852":"Worst experience ever. Loud, dirty, ridiculously slow. I went for a urine drug screening for school and waited for over an hour and a half for my appt.","3077915":"I first heard about this place from a friend ages ago but at that time the NoLibs store was closed. I walked by there today and was amazed at the store. It has just about everything you could need of you were an alternative health nut. I do like to make my own cleaning supplies so it has all that too. I wish the food section was bigger but maybe that's not the purpose (I don't drink tea and I'm not the type to make my own pills). The flowers are a nice deal, though and it's so close to my house. They were also selling orchid plants which were also very reasonably priced but knowing I would kill it dead in about two weeks, I left them there for a more worthy owner and just got cut flowers instead.","3079897":"Beautiful renovation of the store at the same prior location. The store is just spectacular. Larger than before and beautifully constructed  wooden trees and hand carved displays. Great selection of goods and remedies with great service.  So thrilled that they are back and better than ever.  Check out the store. It is absolutely gorgeous.  Plus they preserved the original stained glass address and inlays from the old store.  Really classy.","3084750":"Penn Herb staff is always friendly and pretty knowledgeable about their products. They also offer mail order service if you can't make it to the store. I've used that as well and was very pleased. \nGood store. I highly recommend it.","3096992":"What a gorgeous addition to the neighborhood!  A well thought out store and perfectly organized.  I do like that they have added produce, bread, and other grocery items my only complaint is that the prices are wayyyy out of my price range, especially with other shops on the block selling some brands for $1 or $2 less.  I hope that with volume some of these prices will go down but I do like the convenience of having herbs, oils and other health items very close by. They even have my fav brand of coconut oil so that will keep me coming back:)","3098175":"The waiting room was filthy!!!!!!!   Chinese food left on the table, rug looked like it had not been vacuumed in months, trash overflowing.  Receptionist was rude and just blurted out orders (sign here! sign this! have a seat!).  Went back to phlebotomy station and there was blood on the floors, used bandages w\/ blood on the counters........................I left!!  I was not going to let them stick a needle in my arm after seeing that!!  I ultimately made a complaint to Quest administrative offices!!","3102739":"At a point in my life I used to get my blood work done a lot and every time I'd use Quest, so I'm really used to the drill.  This isn't my favorite location, but it was the closest.\nDON'T DO WALK INS!\nSince this Quest is near Hahnemann, everyone from the hospital is sent here,so make an appointment beforehand.  If you are doing fasting blood work you have to wait at least a week to get a decent early morning appointment.  Go somewhere else if you can't wait all day and need it done that day.\nSeriously, don't be that person that starts to yell at me because you have been waiting all day and I was called first because I made an appointment and you didn't.  \nThe front desk people deal with these people all day, so I try to be friendly to them.\nThe Phlebotomists are friendly and rarely have to re stick, which is good because I pass out when they do.  \nWhen I walk down Broad a lot of people ask me where this location is, even when I'm not going there.  Just look for the Cardiology Consultants of Philadelphia sign and you'll find it.","3115223":"This is the best Quest Diagnostics lab I've ever been to. I made an appointment online for 10:30 AM on a Friday and ended up getting there about 15 minutes before my appointment time. The woman at the front desk was very polite and professional. I had to wait about five minutes while she processed by paperwork\/insurance information, but once she was done she brought me back for my draw.\n\nAs for the blood draw itself, it was sanitary, quick, and painless; probably the best blood draw experience I've had to date. She had no issues inserting the needle and I could hardly see the insertion mark on my arm by nighttime. I was in and out of there within 15 minutes; it doesn't get much better than that!","3119593":"annoyed! drove from blue bell (app. 24 miles and with traffic about 1 hour) to the store that has been there since the 1920's to find a construction site. the building leveled. they need to make that little, tiny blip on their website larger and in a more visible spot so people see it when looking at the address! yes, why don't you put that info next to the address instead of in an obscure place that people only see after they've wasted hours looking for the store!","3127051":"Like Jeffrey C., I was definitely a bit turned off by the overall feel of the place when I walked in.  The waiting room looks like time has passed it by and then some, and there didn't seem to be a whole lot of organization or structure to what was going on in there.  For instance, one of the restrooms (where people, well, pee in a cup) is basically smack in the middle of the waiting room where folks are sitting and waiting.  It was a little unpleasant for me to watch the receptionist transfer someone's urine sample from a big cup to her test tube right in front of me, but that's kind of par for the course at a lab, I suppose.\n\nOnce I got over the initial yuck factor, things started to turn around.  The receptionist was an absolute joy to deal with, and was willing to go above and beyond when it came to making sure my insurance information was correct and that everything would be handled properly.   I made an appointment ahead of time and was seen about 15 minutes after my scheduled appointment.  I don't know if that is normal or not, but I am glad I planned ahead.\n\nThe phlebotomist was also great!  I didn't even feel the needle go in - and felt even better when she complimented me on how well I did.  (Oh, come on, it's the little things!)  Quick and painless.   My bruise today makes me look like I've been hanging out with the wrong kind of crowd, if you know what I mean.... but again, that's par for the course.  You get bloodwork done, you may look a little banged up.  \n\nAll in all, a very positive experience at Quest.","3155185":"Nice selection of stuff and decent prices here. For what I'm working on (simple homemade toiletries) it gets the job done.  The staff was a little dopey, but they were nice which makes up for it.  There's parking right across the street, too!","3159611":"So I went here for a drug test, you know how those parole officers can be...\n\nJust kidding. Half-kidding, because I really did have a drug test here. This place made me almost not take a job back in 2007. Because I had access to a large amount of personal and financial information, my former employer didn't want me to be cracked out. They were pro-misogyny, but anti-drugs. \n\nThis testing location is not a very welcoming place. The employees are not happy, the people getting tested are definitely not happy, and the dankness of the office does not help. I don't know what my expectations were, but I wasn't expecting to be treated like a criminal (I know, I'm naive). Luckily, I didn't have to have blood drawn, or I would have run for the hills like Louise.","3162252":"Waited 2 hours for a simple drug screening. Had to leave since I had prior obligations. I came back the next day and waited another 2 hours to complete a simple drug screening that should take all of 15 mins in and out the door. Very limited staff that does every thing from data entry to doing the actual tests. 2 employees for 20+ patients at a time. Poorly managed site. HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT COMING HERE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME AND ENERGY FOR A DIFFERENT FACILITY.","3171146":"Lady working the front desk next to the gentleman today is super ignorant and disrespectful. 12\/13\/18 2:50pm. I walked in politely and very respectful. Had a simple question and got treated like I wasn't. Something has to be done about that. I'm getting in contact with someone higher up!","3173046":"I made an appointment online three weeks in advance. They confirmed my appointment one week before. Then they called me THE AFTERNOON BEFORE to tell me they no longer had weekend hours.","3187314":"Full disclosure: I totally thought this place was going to bomb based on what I could see when walking by as they were setting up.  However, I could not have been MORE WRONG!  While they have a lot of health products that I likely won't purchase, they have great organic produce for extremely reasonable prices (i.e. Avocado's for $0.99).  They also have nearly every herb\/spice that you could ask for.  I think I have gone here at least 10-15 times and they just opened.  I highly recommend PHC and hope they continue to do well.","3205030":"I recently came here to get labs drawn and I had a pretty good experience.  This was my first experience making the appointments for blood draws and I did so online which was pretty easy but it took me about a week to get an appointment for this location on the day and time that worked best for me.\n\nI have to say that initially I was a bit frustrated with this lab because I had tons of tests to be done from 3 different doctors and just my luck that a lot of them were initially not covered under the first code.  So, I had to call the ordering doctors office and try to get them to communicate with Quest, I was the middle person and ended up having to put my iPhone on speaker so they could communicate because the doctors office couldn't get through to the lab. I even had to go back to the doctors office and get new requisition forms, so I left the lab really frustrated and while this may have been the doctors offices fault, it was a hassle to go through and I wish that they were more helpful other than putting the responsibility on my doctors office.\n\nWhen I was prepared to go through this on round 2, finally everything was covered, yay!  I was glad to be able to get my tests done.  The phlebotomist listened to me and drew my blood in my elbow which is a good vein, it was one stick and done, yeah baby!  As someone who used to be much heavier and used to be stuck a lot, I am slowly getting over my needle phobia.  I just kinda relaxed and was in my zen like place when the needle went into my arm, acupuncture has helped with my anxiety...\n\nI will say that having had about 10-12 tubes of blood drawn, I did feel, quite woozy and tired.  I bought a juice and snack at the nearby 7-11 but I really would have appreciated if the phlebotomist checked to make sure that I was okay because I felt a little faint from all the blood drawn.  It would have been nice if she tried to make sure that I was alright before moving onto the next patient...\n\nConvenient location, understaffed lab!  There was only one person working when I was there, yet I probably will come back again if I had to...","3244019":"Terrible. Incompetent workers. Went there twice on two separate occasions and neither of the employees could draw blood. They were just stabbing at nothing. Extremely painful, and made the trip for nothing. Never had this much difficulty with drawing blood anytime before.","3248065":"I was a walk in and was brought back right away. Renee was very kind during the process and made it quick and painless. Normally people struggle to get my veins the first few times, she got it on the first try. I would definitely use this location again.","3253175":"Honestly, I came into Penn Herb to escape the heat during the 2nd Street Festival.  However, I ended up staying for more than just the AC!\n\nPenn Herb is a rather unique store in my opinion.  It seems to have everything from teas to supplements.  It also has a few more standard offerings like drinks, but it would never been called a 'grocery store' as Christina H also pointed out.\n\nI certainly support pharmaceuticals (with appropriate medical guidance & prescription) but also know there can be a role for other, more basic herbs.  This shop has plenty of variety when it comes to vitamins and such and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable enough to help guide you.  They also had some pretty amazing teas, one of which I headed home with!\n\nPrices are reasonable and as I've said selection is far and wide.  Overall, they might be worth a visit if you find yourself in the area...","3276616":"I recently went to Quest Diagnostics for blood work & the tech that did it did not say one word to me, jammed the needle in my arm & said \"your done\". I woke up feeling like I hard core worked out which is something that has never happened to me before. When I called the customer service line to report this experience a customer service representative by the name of Britney in Kansas was also rude & didn't apologize for the experience I had. She asked me my appointment time & said it will be investigated. I asked what if there were 3 or 4 appointments at that same time, how will you know who the complaint is about. Her response \"the supervisor will figure it out\" what is wrong with this company? I will never walk into another Quest Diagnostics again.","3278877":"Came to give a urine sample for a pre-employment drug test. Had to wait over an hour and every person that worked there was unpleasant. The person at the front desk would leave for 15-20 min at a time. Ended up getting a parking ticket because I didn't expect it to take an hour and a half just to pee in a cup. Ugh.","3281033":"WORST LAB EVER DO NOT GO HERE!!! The lab tech with red hair was AWFUL! I saw the bad reviews before but thought I'd give this place the benefit of the doubt. I'm usually a hard stick so I told the tech and she told me \"well let me see if I can do my job and if I can't you can go somewhere else\" in the rudest tone ever. And then she told me I was free to go but I told her I needed to give a urine sample because one was ordered and she was like oh ok and then gave me a sample cup. Thank goodness I knew what was ordered!! Also, when she put the gauze and tape on my arm after drawing blood, she didn't even cover the wound. I could see the blood still coming out because the gauze wasn't on top of it!! I wish I could give this place negative stars!","3285619":"Very,  very rude. Front desk lady gives you sass the minute you walk in. Don't bother asking any questions,  she'll tell you to sit down until your name is called with the meanest snarl. It wasn't even busy. Would give zero stars if this damn app let me.","3287004":"If you're looking for any finalists or winners of a Personality Plus contest, you are not going to find them here.  When you walk in, no one greets you.  You sign in on the computer and take a seat.  The pickle puss at the front desk, in a very demanding tone of voice, tells you what she needs in terms of paperwork or insurance cards.  Never did I hear the words \"please\" or \"thank you\" uttered by anyone but me.  What is even worse------Attempt to call this office.  There is no way that any of the prompts from the recorded message get you through to the office.  Oh well, this is what we are dealing with in the work force today, sadly even with workers who work with the public.  I did not see anything that even came close to a smile---not even a single tooth being displayed.","3289386":"Horrible, just horrible.\n\nI was instructed to come here, for a drug screening.  I was told over the phone by the company that sent me here that I didn't need an appointment.\n\nI hoped to be there for 20 minutes, max.\n\nThese inept fools had me sitting around for AN HOUR!  Have you ever had to HOLD your PEE for AN HOUR??!!?!  Ridiculous.\n\nThe woman who took my sample was curt, and near belligerent.  If I can warn at least one person to NEVER come here, then I'll feel a sense of accomplishment","3302499":"The customer service was horrible I asked the guy if they had a certain herb and he acted like he didn't even want to search and see on the computer he did one search for me and then he wouldn't search anymore and then referred me to another employee to find the one herb that he did search But the staff that day did not seem very knowledgeable or helpful at all.. \nI appreciate the response from the owner, the staff never told me about their kiosk machines. It's good to know","3311467":"I created a Yelp account just to write a review about this place...\n\nI made an appointment online for 7:30 am (when this Quest location opens). After casually rolling up 40 minutes late to open, the staff member nicely stabbed my arm for my routine blood work. She didn't have any trouble finding a vein and there was no struggle - which is why I was surprised? disturbed? to find my whole right arm swollen and bruised the next day. Over the next few days, it only looks and feels worse. She must have burst an artery because 8 days later, I sit in my cubicle writing this review, with a black and blue arm, getting concerning looks from coworker\/friends. I hope I can start utilizing my right arm normally again soon.\n\nAnyone have a recommendation for a lawyer?\n\nGod Bless","3315567":"For starters it looks like I am not the only one who had to waste their time here. It is poorly managed. As I arrived there were 4 people waiting and out of the two employees, one of them decided to go on break leaving for more than 45 minutes (not sure how long their lunch is) -- nothing wrong with taking a break but come on, you see it's busy and people seemed to be waiting more than 1 hour just to get the appropriate tests done. \nAs soon as I let the gentleman know that I wanted my ID back and did not want to wait, he caught an attitude with me which was very unprofessional on his behalf. What is the point of getting my information if I have to wait about 30 more minutes on top of the 45 I spent after checking in? \nPlus, to the guy who was there today, do not ever raise your voice at anybody. You definitely need training on customer service. \n\nDO NOT RECOMMEND. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!","3322109":"What is the point of making an appointment here? I set my appointment weeks in advance and when I walked in, I see the room is absolutely full.  There were maybe three empty chairs among perhaps four rows of seating.  I registered on the touchpad and about 10 minutes later, I noticed my name was next on the electronic screen.  The screen also noted that I had an appointment and everyone else on the list was a walk-in.  Well, that screen said that my wait time was 5 minutes (even though it was already several minutes past my appointment time).  That status remained on the screen for about 10 minutes.  When someone finally came out from the back (the front desk was empty most of the time I was there), she said \"Next!\" then took a walk-in.  I looked at the screen and my name was gone.  I said to her, \"I was next.  I was on the screen.\"  She said \"Sorry, I'm here alone today.  All these people are ahead of you.\"  WHAT IS THE POINT OF MAKING APPOINTMENT IF WALK-INS ARE AHEAD OF ME?  AND IF THEY'RE JUST GOING TO ERASE MY APPOINTMENT FROM THE SCREEN?  I wasted 50 minutes today on these jerks.  \n\nThen, while I was on my way out the door, she had the nerve to say \"If you're cancelling, you gotta give me your name.\"  Like I should waste more time on her?  Give me a break.","3324967":"I went into the store found EVERYTHING I needed, checked out & was home within 40 min. This is impressive because I live on a whole other side of town! Their store is so perfectly organized it's virtually impossible to not find what you're looking for. Thanks for making shopping for my cold & flu season necessities a breeze!","3325770":"Quest Diagnostics of Bryn Mawr, Pa has ONE staffer running their entire facility- I asked, this is normal.  She does registration, draws blood, does data entry, billing, and scheduling as needed for walk-ins.  When I arrived at 11 am, 29 patients had been processed-- and she is ALL ALONE. This is unprofessional at best, likely illegal-- and should be investigated.  I am simply horrified that Quest Diagnostics would run its services in this manner.  TERRIBLE!","3326961":"I really don't like writing negative reviews, but this experience has left me a bit perturbed. While I am an Amazon fan\/customer, I purposely chose to support a local business that has had a good reputation and that's been around for years. Upon checking out last Friday, my wallet turned over and a few items dropped out. I picked what I believed to have been everything, made my purchase and went on my way. About an hour later I realized that my Apple Airpods were not in my purse. So I called the store and asked if anyone had found them, the young lady confirmed that they had and I was only across the street in a cafe so I went right over to retrieve the Airpods. When I got there the young lady went into the back to get them, and when she came back up front she was on the telephone with an employee named Elizabeth trying to get instructions on where Elizabeth had put them. I was then asked if I wanted to leave my address so that Elizabeth could drop them off to me the following day. I did not want to leave my home address with a stranger so I told them that I would return to get them. When I called the next day, Elizabeth was not at work. I asked when she would be back in and was told today so I went in to the store today. When the manager sent Elizabeth out, she asked me to show her a picture of the Airpods. I told her that I didn't have a picture as I called in specifically asking if they had been found. It's not like they sent out a notice asking if anyone had lost them. Then I asked about the store's lost and found and she told me that they were in her locker. When asked why she didn't really give me an explanation and I could see that she was becoming defensive. Not in a hostile manner, but just no longer pleasant. She told me that I should be careful with my things and I should have heard it drop (mind you, I had other items drop out of my wallet that made a sound), she also said, \"If another customer had picked them up I would not even had gotten them back.\" That was not the point and I found that to be very unprofessional. I felt like she was upset that I wanted my items back. As she walked away, she repeated that I should be careful the next time. Well, best believe there will be no next time. I was really hoping to start a relationship with this business, as I said they have a great reputation, they are only a few blocks away and they have a plethora of health items available. But Customer Service is and has always been a huge factor in where I spend my money.","3341864":"I was looking for some hard to find herbs and found this store online. Wow I'm in love! It's so bright and beautiful, reminds me of Whole Foods but with only the cosmetics, pharmacy, and dried goods sections. The store associates were friendly and greeted me as soon as I walked in the door. They helped me find my products and let me browse the shelves at my leisure even 10 minutes before closing without rushing me or being nosy with what I was looking to buy. \n\nIn addition to herbs and vitamins, I was impressed with this store's display of tinctures, teas, coffee, gourmet foods, kitchen tools, skin care products, etc. Basically this a show room version of online vitamin stores like Vitacost or LuckyVitamin. Every shelf was so organized and everything stacked so neatly and clearly labeled.\n\nThe only down side is the prices are not as cheap as online retailers, but if you need herbs, tinctures, and other woo woo witch doctor-ish remedies and don't feel like waiting to get stuff shipped, this is the store for you! The selection can't be beat. It's super convenient to get here by the Market-Frankford subway line, as it's a minute walk from the Spring Garden station.\n\nSuch a charming store for a new age\/alternative medicine nut like me. I will be back!","3345645":"I was a little weary about visiting this Quest location because of all the previous reviews. However, I was pleasantly surprised with my experience today. The woman at the front desk that helped me (I didn't catch her name) was nice and made me laugh a few times as we talked about the traffic in the surrounding area. The waiting area was clean and tidy. This location is convenient if you live close by, but I can see where parking might be an issue for those who are driving. If I could offer one piece of advice to anyone who's deciding whether or not to visit this Quest location, it would be to come as early as possible to avoid a long wait. I came in just after opening and I waited maybe 20 minutes tops. If you show up later in the day, you'll probably have a much longer wait. Even though there are a ton of negative reviews, I had a nice experience at this location and I would return again if necessary.","3349837":"This is very frustrating. I woke up early and took the septa to the lap for my appointment test. I arrived at 9:28am my appointment was at 10am. I talked the black lady who works at registration counter. She asked for my full name and date of birth. After I gave her all my information she told me that the lap didn't have the test kit I have to contact my service to ask them to send me to another lap. I left and went home. It's rainy day and heavy rain in Philly today. I got home my service contacted me and let me know the lap doesn't need the kit to test me because the test kit for home testing only. The service sent me to the lap because they wanted me to get a person testing, so the lady who works at the registration doesn't know anything and she sounded so rude. If she doesn't know anything why does she work there? She should have confirmed with other people who work their if she didn't know. It wasted my time because my service told me the lap doesn't the test kit to test me. I wondered how can she work there? I don't know her name, but she is a young black lady with red hair color. She was very rude.","3363863":"I had a great experience. The girl who was there was very professional and didn't take long either.","3376240":"Slow. Understaffed. Slow. Awful. Dont go here.\nThey are friendly, after your hour wait that is.\nPainful experience, don't go. \nSupposed to be appointment only, but isnt.","3383815":"Woman in the front needs an attitude check. Never met someone so rude in my life. Go somewhere else.","3388098":"I am So Grateful these folks exist!!!!....I made an order on a Monday evening, paid for the 3-5 day shipping and was stressing I wouldnt get my order in time for what I needed....To my Surprise, The package came the Next DAy....Now i am right over the bridge in Jersey, But Great Service...the products are Top Notch Quality and came in Great packaging...I was referred to these guys by my Amazing Herbal Teacher, Jeannie Francis from Merchantville...Thank you to All the Amazing Folks who make this situation an option to All of us :)","3397292":"I love that this is a family owned and operated business that clearly takes pride in what they do! They have a great selection of products including over 400 herbs. My husband and I are also big fans of their Olbas line for when we come down with the occasional cold. And if you need recommendations on other natural remedies, their staff is an excellent resource!","3414139":"The greedy owners are just charging for bags now! As if they aren't making enough money of us already.","3418788":"The worst!  The technician showed up late (the lab wasn't even open yet at the time of my appointment!), she ignored my cheerful good morning, then she almost knocked me down to go in, and then continued to be rude the whole time, talking about me to the other technician while I left.","3423908":"This was bad. I showed up on time for my appointment (had to get a routine test for work), and after about 20 minutes they called me in. The employees were talking about the Teletubbies for a long time before they were able to help me. That was strangely entertaining, but not what I was there for. The actually testing process felt weird and open- my sample was being waved about practically in the waiting room. Just felt unclean. I had to do it, though. If you have any ability to go somewhere else, USE IT.","3432991":"I first discovered Penn Herb Co. when I lived in Colorado and became enamoured with Chap-a-Grips.  On a frantic search to buy a dozen or so for some goody bags I was assembling for volunteers of a golf tournament, I discovered the web site (which I just added to this site).  I placed my order and was so very happy that I ended up an avid catalog friend for the next several years.  Upon my recent visit to the city of Philadelphia, I simply had to go in and see this place.  Honestly, I had no idea that the place would be so small!  I had envisioned the Ikea of herbs and vitamin supplements.  Not at all.  This place is small but not cramped yet chock full of every possible goodness that you could imagine!  I stocked up on these crazy travel toothbrush sanitizer covers.  I love them - I only wish I had tried the cinnamon scent too.  Oh well, I will just go on their cool web site until I can get back down to Philly.  The people were very friendly and helpful as well.  Not that I had  any questions but I observed them with other customers.  Certainly go in and at least say hi to these folks!","3449355":"Helpful friendly staff. As a disabled person a lot I did not understand, they researched my questions and kindly walked me to item locations, not high-pressure sales I appreciate that","3450635":"Fantastic place for all things natural, organic and while. I've been a customer for over 25 years.","3451671":"The name is a tad deceiving. While Penn Herb Company has hands down, THEE most impressive collection of vitamins, supplements, herbal and Homeopathic remedies I've ever seen, they also have lots of fantastic snacks, wholesome foods, organic gift items, fresh floral bouquets, wellness books, candles, salts and all things one needs for living a healthy lifestyle! \n\nThe store is bright, well stocked, neatly merchandised and adorable with floor to ceiling wooden trees! \n\nI picked up some snacks for the kiddos, some Bragg's natural products which are my kitchen must haves, and some vegan grocery items from the freezer section for myself. Prices were comparable to what I'm used to paying at WFM. \n\nI'm not sure if the entire place is plant-based, but I was unable to find a quick meal for the carnivore hubs. Totally not an issue for me though! \n\nI could've spent hours browsing, but was in the 30 minute loading zone out front so...\n\nThe staff were all so helpful and friendly. Sign up for their rewards program! \n\nDefinitely a great place to stop for quick veg based meal prep when you don't want to do a whole market trip, and it's probably the best place in Philly for vitamins and such.","3454644":"I am a lifetime sufferer of anxiety whenever I have my blood drawn. I have a number of stupid mental rituals that I use whenever a doctor or television show requests my precious bodily fluid. This time, I didn't need any of them. Alresea at this location has given me the first blood drawing experience in my life where I didn't fall down or otherwise embarrass myself with incoherent babbling. I experienced no pain and absurdly friendly service. I'm so excited that I am writing this on my phone as I walk home, risking a collision with strangers about every four seconds. \n\nYep. I'm so happy that I've actually become very inconsiderate to the walking needs of others. Thanks, Quest Diagnostics on Walnut!","3457165":"Schedule an appointment for a pcr test one week in advance. Showed up, checked In With their system multiple times, reminders and all. Arrived and they said we don't have any Covid test. I asked them what do you mean? I have an appointment and shouldn't you cancel my appointment if you didn't have any. They said the computer system didn't know and I should had called them to confirm, placing the blame on me as if I was the one who should be doing the job of correlating their appointment slots with their supply chain. I will never get service for any quest diagnostics location again.","3458827":"Absolutely horrific customer service and an utter lack of transparency (they also wouldn't even give me a bandaid after my blood was drawn and used tape instead). They had me sign my name that I accept the tests being ordered and would not allow me to take a photo or get a receipt of the sheet I was signing. I asked to see a supervisor to see if I could receive a teceipt and they refused. Quest is an example of everything that is wrong with healthcare delivery in this country. I'm never going back here again.","3462178":"Aromatherapy, Herbalism, Natural Healing, all of these needs were satisfied through Penn Herb\nand Samara Botane. My Wife had been going to Penn Herb for a few things to help her and her\nMother bake and cook, plus a few Herbal Teas and Cold Remedies.\nAfter we were married, She started having Health Problems, that Modern Medicine called: Ladies Problems \" AND those its in your head maladies.\n\nThen, Miracle of Miracles these Problems women had in their heads developed Scientific\nNames.

I have been calling them for 2 days straight to get my appointment changed else where. No answer. I called while I was sitting there, not one phone rang. The woman was extremely racist. Only nice to people of any color but white. The gentleman was the only nice one! On their cell phones the whole time! I recommend no one going to this place! The only reason they even got one star from me was because I had to.","3464224":"After a rocky first visit, I was contacted by the owner who apologized for my initial experience and convinced me to give this business another chance. I was very pleased and impressed by her response and felt that it was a sincere and genuine one. I decided to give the store another shot and I must say that I felt much better about supporting this local, family business. The Manager, John was very helpful, he was very knowledgeable about the items that I was looking for and interested in. He even apologized for the experience that I had encountered on my first visit. This made me feel as if my experience was important to them as a customer and it also replaced any negative impressions that I had had before. I look forward to returning as I was able to skim some of the products and saw that they carry much more than I had initially thought. This place is more than just an herb\/vitamin supplier, but they even have healthy entrees and pantry items that I usually travel to Whole Foods to get. I am happy about my visit and my discoveries and look forward to returning.","3469787":"This office is an absolute joke. First of all, I had a 90 minute wait to get my test completed. I wouldn't even be angry about that if it were the only problem. Here's the kicker... THEY LOST MY DRUG TEST RESULT. My employment was delayed by a week because of the shenanigans at this office. They're understaffed (even at peaks times) and unprofessional. Go somewhere else.","3471521":"Living in No.Libs can be a little difficult at times. I personally despise the Acme up the street, so I balance between Penn Herb company and Whole Foods. They have PLENTY of vegan\/veggie options that are moderately priced. \n\nWhile Penn Herb isn't necessarily a \"grocery store\" and you couldn't survive on only their supplies, their choices are excellent. If you're into herbal remedies this place is for you! \n\nOne aspect that really stood out to me-the customer service is absolutely outstanding. A few weeks back, I purchased 2 avocados to find that they were rotten to the core after I got home. Of course it was my fault for not really checking enough when I picked them up, but they had expired produce displayed for sale. The next time I returned to the store,I explained the situation to the cashier not expecting anything other than a coupon or a \"sorry\" but she actually replaced my items!\n\nIt's really the little things when it comes to a small business-which is why Penn Herbs deserves nothing less than 5 stars.","3471571":"I had an appointment for a blood test yesterday.  It was considerable and 13 separate tubes of blood were required.  I am vasovagal so I have to lie down when I get blood drawn.  People can react to that in one of two ways: Either they recognize that it is an issue and try to be kind and helpful or they act like you are just trying to make their day harder.  I got the second reaction.  Then, as the woman is taking my blood, tube after tube, she keeps admonishing me for pumping my fist, even though it is going completely numb.  She finally finishes and just leaves the room.  I sit up to drink some juice (since I had to fast 14 hours and that doesn't help).  I'm there for maybe a minute and another woman comes in and demands that I leave, saying \"well, you're sitting up so you must be fine.\" No, it wouldn't be possible to drink if I weren't sitting up.  Terrible service!  Terrible experience.  Terrible company.","3476003":"I appreciate the customer service and the variety of vitamins and minerals they offer. \n\nThe store is large enough to accommodate social distance and space to roam around. I'll admit I haven't see. The whole store. I'm not that type of shopper. I typically have a list and I get what I want and leave. I did the same during my most recent visit. However I noticed social distance spacing is clearly indicated on the floors to guide customers to the register which I appreciate. It alleviates me from conversing with other other customers during COVID. \n\nNevertheless the space is clean and the service is superb. There's assistance if you need it. Oh the have vitamins in oil form too for those who prefer it to pills. It's behind a counter so you will need to get help if that's your preference. \n\nOverall I really like this location. It's very close to my home and Center City. More importantly I'm always in and out since there aren't any long lines.","3485389":"And one star might be a lot. I was there for a blood draw for my one year old. The welcome was terrible. The front desk lady was rude and unprofessional, giving a hell a lot of attitude. Behind her desk, I could barely hear her and I had to ask her to repeat what she was asking, which I guess got on her nerve and here was the attitude. Not a Hi, Hello, thank you, please or goodbye. Basically impolite! The blood draw took a long 1 min. Holding a toddler for that long as he was crying and trying move, made it a very long minute. The needle might have been too deep in the vein, I don't know, but he started bleeding through the draw. Not a good experience at all overall. Will not be back!","3493684":"I was happy to be able to make my appointment online, and they had early morning hours. This made it easy for me to schedule around my work. You do have to wait a little, but I never waited more than 15 minutes at a time. Everyone from the receptionist to the nurse to the physician's assistant was kind and knowledgeable. They were all nonjudgmental. I felt like I was heard and treated with a lot of respect. I am usually nervous going to any kind of medical office, but this was one of the most positive experiences I have had with a doctor. I will definitely be coming back when I need it.","3498501":"This is a really good Labcorp office. I chose this one based on negative reviews of other locations and positive reviews of this location. It was definitely the right call. The receptionist was professional and kind and I was seen right on time. Most importantly, they were very understanding about my embarrassing and pretty intense blood work phobia. They let me bring my husband in with me to hold my hand without batting an eye. The phlebotomist was skilled and friendly and a really good sport about my crying. I'm pregnant so everything makes me cry now. She took it in stride and did an amazing job. I will definitely be using this office for all of my pregnancy blood work. I might not even cry next time.","3503707":"Staff is so friendly and they honored my appointment  with no wait time! If I need to get any other tests done I will come back here","3505695":"This was my first time in an Urgent Care and I was very impressed. I visited this location while staying at a friend's place in Philly. It was the closest open Urgent Care center. Employees were very nice and after the wait, they got me in and out very quickly. I would definitely return, and the care could not have been better.","3507145":"Very rude and unprofessional lab techs! Normally they have you watch them open up a new cup and seal it with your urine sample with you in the room- but that wasn't the case. Just hoping they don't mess up my sample and falsely accuse my results. If you can avoid going here, please do yourself the favor.","3512070":"Receptionists are always so rude here... it's not our fault if you hate your job! Don't make us pay for it...","3532008":"Their staff and service is great. Of course there is a wait since it an Urgent Care but do not fret because they have a great waiting area. The service of being seen by the provider was fairly quick and painless. They were very organized, very clean, great service,  and all under an hour. \n\nGreat place!","3542008":"I go nowhere else. Service is outstanding. You get the personalized attention you remember for your pharmacy.  Jason takes his time to answer all your questions and will go out of his way to handle any problems with your medication.  I drive 20 minutes from my house just to go here.","3561289":"I'm such a huge advocate for Planned Parenthood services and would really like to give more stars. I genuinely believe in the message of planned parenthood, and as a MSW candidate I refer many clients here, which is why I decided to use services myself. \n\nThe staff were kind and helpful for the most part, but the appointments are a joke. In order to get an iud out in and my implant removed, I had to have three separate appointments. I understand appointment time is limited, but it would have been a much better use of their time, and certainly mine to do them in the same appointment. The first appointment I waited 45 minutes after my appointment to be seen on a Saturday. On a Monday I waited an hour after my appointment and was this late for work after getting the IUD put it. I asked them to take the implant out then because I did not want it in any more and they said they wouldn't because the IUD wouldn't be 100% effective. I said I would abstain from sex and they still said no. That is not trusting women with their health care and I was incredibly upset by this. I am in charge of my body and my reproduction.\n\nI am currently at my appointment to get the implant out. The appointment was schedule for 11:30. It's been over two and a half hours of sitting here waiting without a word on when I will be seen. As the sign on the door said no food or drinks, I haven't had any water since I came in at 11:20. This is completely unacceptable. I will be very blatant with clients in the future when referring them to this planned parenthood. Clearly too many appointments are scheduled in a day, and that needs to be fixed. This would not be the norm over weeks at a clinic in w hospital and I genuinely believe that because PP serves generally poor women that this is why it happens, and that women who have access to only Planned Parenthood care get less of a say in their health care than their wealthier counterparts, and also receive lesser care because of their income status. That is not okay, and not what PP stands for. I'm terribly disappointed and disillusioned.","3567302":"One of the worst establishments I've ever been to. Tiffany at the front desk was extremely rude, unhelpful, and has no customer service skills. In front of me, she inappropriately joked to her coworker that one of the people in the waiting room is related to him (both the client and the coworker of an Asian descent). She also said he has to \"deal with her\" because she can't. Completely disrespectful to everyone. It was baffling.","3567993":"Don't come to this location if you want to be treated with respect! The wait was well over 2 hours long, the staff acted as if they had no idea what customer service means and the nurses seemed disinterested. Um, I didn't know you were doing me a favor by doing your job. I asked general health questions and she brushed them aside as if she had no time for them. The woman running the payment options also had an attitude.   Steer clear and find another location, one where you're actually given some decency.","3582199":"As the other reviews stated, the staff is unbelievably rude and treats you like you're some kind of scum. Avoid if possible","3601741":"THE WORST!!!!!! Had appointment for 2:30 pm, showed up early at 2:18 pm..... Got seen at 4:11 pm! Wtf is the purpose of having an appointment if you're going to make me wait that long?!! Then I finally get back and am out by 434. Soooooo its not like I had an hour procedure done or anything. \n\nPlanned parenthood is a joke. I will continue my services at professional doctors offices. \n\nI should have never signed the petition to not get your facilities closed down, they should be. \n\nAn apology for waiting over and hour and a half would have been nice.","3609764":"Decided to come here so I didn't have to wait for an appointment next week with my regular doctor who sees me on a sliding scale at the Mazzoni Center. Made a 1:00 appointment which I figured would be 1,2,3. Okay... maybe not quite, but, an hour's wait tops.\n\nGot there a little under 10 minutes early and filled out this form. Office is def nicer than the one on Chestnut Street which is a plus. Waited about 15 minutes and was called again to give my ID. Answered a bunch of questions about my home life, signed some agreements, and was told to sit again. \n\nBy this time it is about 3. Why did I schedule something ahead of time again? I go back and get my test done. Nurse goes over some things including a possible follow-up then a clinician who talks to me about birth control and Plan B. Stuff of that nature. Both were very professional and actually seemed interested in my health then comes to kicker...\n\nI am told to wait a couple minutes to check out. Alrighty. Cool, cool. I sit at this desk and after asking me my name and a couple other things...she says,\"Your total is $20.\" I'm not stingy and I'm not completely broke, but, there are times when you really don't have the cash to spare. I could of been told ahead of time when we went over my income level which isn't much at all.\n\nHow did that even cost that much? I thought they were there to provide services for low-income people and I felt in better hands rather than relying on cheap pregnancy tests. Yes, I went there. I'm a grown woman with one sex partner for almost 3 years. It wouldn't of been the end of the world and have made ends meet before. Moving on...I wasn't even sure if I brought anything with me other than bus fare. I proceed to tell her I'm not sure if I have enough. You know what she says? \"Can you call somebody for the money?\" \n\nWhat made this chick think I was gonna sit there like a JO and do that ?!?! Did she forget where we were?  I begrudgingly dug through my bag, found a bill stashed outside of my wallet,and walked out to carry on my day. \n\nI'm sure they do provide a service to many women that they can't get elsewhere because of lack of insurance or for privacy reasons, but, they really come off as money hungry. Not to mention, the wait time is ridiculous. I almost did walk out before they called my name. \n\nTwo stars for the nice,welcoming office and the a-okay medical staff.","3615908":"MONEY WELL SPENT!!!! When I discovered that my three daughters had lice I was super stressed.  I called LiceDoctors in the morning and Stephanie arrived at my house the same day!  I was so relieved to have a professional meticulously go through each head of hair to identify and get rid of any nits and louse.  I feel confident with this one visit and our follow up treatment plan that we will be LICE FREE!  Thanks Stephanie :-)","3617012":"This is such a big, beautiful space with a lot of potential. The waiting area is large and clean. My complaint is the front desk staff and the woman who took me to the exam room. It was my first visit to this PP and I was not sure where to go. There were a couple of different people sitting in the reception desk area and no one even looked up. When I finally caught someone's eye I just said, \"Sorry...I've never been here.\" The patient rep just looked at me annoyed and said, \"Well... do you have an appointment?\" and then slid piece of paper to me.\n\nI am a patient service representative at a local hospital and I do not treat people this way. Perhaps saying, \"Good Morning! Do you have an appointment? Please fill out this slip of paper and bring it back when you're done. There are clip boards and pens here and the waiting area is to your right.\" It's not difficult. I can't imagine being a vulnerable young person walking into this clinic for the first time. With this kind of service.. I would have been nervous and walked out. Planned Parenthood has to be better. People already have a biased view of the quality of care in a PP. We need not perpetuate these negative views.\n\nI took my slip of paper up to the front and 10 minutes later someone barked my name over the speaker. I walk up to the window and the same rude woman just said, \"I need your ID.\" Working in the medical field and knowing she doesn't have my insurance information I asked, \"Would you like my insurance card as well?\" With another snooty attitude she said, \"Well..yeah. If you have insurance.\" \n\nFast forward to 40 minutes after my appointment time when I am finally in the exam room dropping off my belongings before my urinalysis. The woman in scrubs asks about the reason for my visit. I tell her my concerns and she gives me completely false information. So bad that I had to correct her so she didn't repeat this false information to anyone else. If you're not a doctor or a NP with extensive knowledge you shouldn't be giving your medical opinion. \n\nWhen I finally say the DR\/NP I wasn't even examined. She asked all of the normal questions and then prescribed an antibiotic. It would have been nice to be examined as I was already there for an exam.\n\nYou have to be better. Vulnerable populations are counting on you for their healthcare.","3636821":"Came here to get a PPD. Service was very good! The young man at the front desk was so professional and guided me through all of the paperwork intake. Very short wait time. I was in and out in about 20 minutes. The nurse who did my PPD was very friendly and conversational. Would definitely recommend this place to others.","3641039":"I gave this location 5 stars based on their clean and modern appearance along with their short wait time. The doctor and staff were great too. I will definitely be coming back the next time I get sick.","3641153":"Jefferson never disappoints! The customer service was excellent. The administrative staff were patient, kind and very professional. I had called to schedule an evening appointment for a MRI & CT SCAN earlier in the week. When I'd gotten there I was confirmed for the MRI but somehow the CT SCAN was on the calendar for the next day. I was a little upset, but didn't show it, mistakes happen. Well the ladies at the front desk worked pretty diligently to get me in to have both done while I was there and were successful. Everyone that I came in contact with that day was superb. I am proud to be a Jeff patient!","3641766":"I was told to be here at 2:30 due to set up for the procedure and check in paperwork . That was done in ten minutes . My actual appointment was at 3:30 I left work early and still have not been called for wardrobe  change or set up . Parking is an issue around here and it would have been nice to have been informed about possible parking validation and the long wait . I was only told about the length of the procedure .  I get this is a hospital and waits are expected but don't cost me time from my job of its not needed . Highly annoyed .","3657674":"Received great, timely service from lice doctors when my younger daughter came home with lice recently. I called lice doctors at 8am and Cely was at our house by 1pm the same day. Cely was kind, thorough and professional. The treatment was all-natural. We followed the recommended 3-week aftercare protocol and the whole thing was successful. Overall I thought it was a good value. I highly recommend lice doctors for anyone that wants professional lice removal help.","3661789":"We had a wonderful experience using Lice Doctors.  I wanted to feel certain we did not have a reinfestation.  Gloria not only took care of my daughter's hair, checked the rest of our family, but also educated us throughly about life and why the process they use works.  I would not hesitate to call in them again (although I hope we won't need to!). It was money well spent!","3662344":"NP was nice, but the the operation is clearly rushed and the staff harried. Had to wait ~1.5 hours to be seen, with an additional hour afterwards just to receive a prescription. I don't blame them personally; the issues are systemic and inherent to our obscene, piecemeal, private healthcare model.","3677051":"So far so good. Offered free hot applied cider during the Mayfair thanksgiving parade. Friendly, hospitable and great customer service. Switched my pharmacy prescription plan to them real quick. They're open until 6pm during the week which is awesome for me. They even gave me free gifts (Tylenol and cough drops) for signing up.","3677213":"I noticed a strange  insect bite  on my arm, which was far too trivial for an ER trip, and would surely have disappeared by the time I got an appointment with my primary.  I discovered a new Urgent Care office in my neighborhood.  Yes, one can simply walk in--or make an appointment online. I walked in, handed over my ID and insurance card (dont forget those).  Rich at the front desk was very helpful and patient.\n   I waited roughly 30 minutes to be seen by the RN who took a health history.  Then a nurse practitioner looked at the bite, followed by an MD.  All were professional, well-informed, and kind .   (Isn't it great when MD's have both doctor skills and people skills?)\n     I got a lesson in what various bites look like, and mine is nothing to worry about.  I was offered a Rx for a steroid cream, but no one insisted.   If it doesn't go away or gets worse, I was invited to call back and get the Rx.\n    Out of pocket this wd have cost $99.   Since I have insurance the co-pay was $40, and well worth it to have the peace of mind.\nDeborah Luepnitz","3687791":"I have always had a positive experience at this Planned Parenthood location. Yes. You might have to wait a bit- even if you have an appointment. Yes- the folks at the front desk might not be so pleasant sometimes- especially after a long and loaded day. I have always been well taken care of, and given comfort and compassion.","3689676":"My favorite pharmacy from any I've ever used. Great prices and very cute little store. They always have everything I need in stock and the pharmacist is very nice and knowledgeable.","3694056":"I used to work for a chain pharmacy, so I know firsthand how terrible they treat their pharmacists. I refuse to give my money to a huge corporation anymore. I've made the switch to First Class Pharmacy for a few reasons, one being that Jason is the absolute best. He goes above and beyond for whatever I need, and always in a timely fashion. His relationship with patients bring back that \"old corner drugstore\" feel which is something lacking from these chain pharmacies. Try this place out, you won't be sorry!","3694768":"I saw all of the negative reviews before I went but figured I'd check it out for myself because I support PP and what they do and have had great experiences at other locations. Sure enough I had a great experience! I came early on a Thursday so the office was pretty quiet. The staff was personable and helpful. I waited about 30 minutes to be seen. I can imagine it'd be different at a busier time but as far as the kindness of the staff and the cleanliness of the facility I think they are doing a great job.","3708080":"This place is ran by a bunch of imbeciles. Do not go here unless you have 2.5+ hours, even with an appointment. Every time I come here I am waiting at least 45 minutes to be called back and even more until I see a nurse.","3718568":"Don't go here! One person in office doing front desk and lab work. Poked both arms and couldn't draw blood. Told me to go to another location.\nUnderstaffed, Untrained and unprofessional.\nWent to another location,  1,2,3 done!","3733324":"BE PREPARED FOR A VERY LONG WAIT - UNDERSTAFFED!  Why in the middle of cold and flu season would they only staff with one medical assistant and one doctor!  Went there due to the convenience of the location and spent over three hours there!!!  Only to be told that I had a respiratory infection.  If the doctor spent less than five minutes with me, why did the visit take so long.  Very frustrating.  Now I will have to pay special attention to my bills after reading about how they overcharge.","3743284":"Very short wait, but staff seemed like they could not care less. Guess it doesn't matter for them since drug testing is required.","3746333":"New pharmacy in NE Philly. Very friendly pharmacist there named Jason. They happened to be giving away free water ice the day I was visiting!","3753569":"My kid had the flu and we ended up here. It was quick, efficient, super clean. So pleased with our care. Doctor was thorough and kind. Our prescriptions were called in on the spot and Dr.'s note for school. Big waiting area with comfortable couches, water, coffee and snacks. Made an unpleasant experience bearable.","3758775":"I went to this PP location this summer and the experience was awful overall. As most others mentioned, there was a long wait time; for the simple tests I was having done, it took about three hours from start to finish (most of that time waiting in the waiting room or on a bench waiting to check out, which it turned out I didn't even need to do but they told me I did and let me sit there for a long time before telling me I actually didn't). The reception staff were also rude, though the doctors and nurses I interacted with were very nice. Nonetheless, the staff frequently seemed confused about various processes necessary to get the patient seen and out, which was worrisome. HOWEVER, the worst part of this visit was that they actually lost my test specimen, and did not let me know until more than two weeks after my appointment. At the appointment, which was on a Wednesday, I was told that if I didn't receive a call by Monday of the next week, I could assume all the tests were negative. For obvious reasons, them losing my specimen and not telling me for so long was extremely dangerous and irresponsible. Many tests they perform there are used by individuals to determine if they can safely have sex with partners, and allowing someone to believe their tests are negative could have a serious and irreversible consequence for that person's life, not to mention their partner's life. Luckily it did not have that consequence for me but it was scary and upsetting to have that happen. I feel especially concerned because the woman who called to tell me about the specimen being lost indicated this happened often at this particular PP location because of disorganization and high patient volume. I will not be coming back to this location.","3766141":"My first experience was pretty awful but I thought I would give it a second chance. I have lived in few different cities and have always gone to Planned Parenthood for my contraceptive needs. I support what they stand for & up until now it has been a fairly pleasant experience. \n\nBoth times I have been here I have waited an hour after my appointment even though I showed up early to do any needed paperwork and things of that nature. & the front desk is so incredibly rude. It's not the hard to be nice & welcoming. They make you feel like you are bothering them. \n\nIt's a shame that they are not more welcoming and accommodating here.","3772395":"I have been waiting 45 minutes even though I have an appointment.  Only one tech working!","3780927":"My insurance mandates I use Lab Core for all my lab work and sample collection, and they make it as efficient and professional as possible, while also being genuine and courteous.","3795599":"My gynologist ordered a routine mammogram and Jefferson did a diagnostic mammogram.\n\nA routine mammorgram is free with my health insurance.  They refused to adjust the coding and charged me.  They said \"they did the work and need to be paid.\"  \n\nHighly recommend University of Pennsylvania!  Stay away from Jefferson.","3801763":"The staff was very pleasant and friendly.  It was pretty crowded but they move fast.  I will definitely return to this location.  Excellent service.","3805280":"The LabCorp on S. 6th street is the worst experience. The wait times are long, even with few people in waiting area. And the staff are unfriendly; hostile even. \nDo yourself a favor and find another lab or location.","3819187":"The staff at the Front Street location are always so nice and the services are really fast...I love their self check in kiosks also.","3841035":"Very professional and very effective.  They were quick to respond which meant our situation didn't worsen and after following their treatment recommendation we had complete success.  Luckily it hasn't happened again, but if it did, I know who to call!","3874370":"This location is much cleaner and efficient than ones I've been to out in the suburbs. All of the women at reception are extremely helpful with questions about insurance and scheduling. \n\nKia is my favorite nurse; informative, personable and always pleasant. I would highly recommend this location. Even when I've done a walk in I haven't waited nearly as long as at other medics offices.","3881853":"Convenient new location downtown on Broad St. right across the street from the hospital.  When you google the address, it will show the Walgreens at this address.  Never fear!  It is just next door.  I guess they share the same mailing address.\n\nThe entrance is a door just to the left of Walgreens.  You have to be buzzed in & then you proceed down a hallway until you get to their door with a very small sign on the right-hand side.  Labcorps can be tricky to find for some reason.  This is not the first one with really inadequate signage I've encountered.\n\nAt any rate, since it's a relatively new location, it was completely quiet when I arrived at LUNCH time no less!  A nice change, although I'm sure this will change.  You have to find street parking, and on Broad St this is not easy.  However, there is plenty of parking on the west-bound side of Vine St.  I parked in front of the school at a meter & just walked a half block to get here.  Super easy.\n\nTheir online appointment system is very easy to use.  They also take walk-ins.","3887464":"It makes me a bit sad to see so many strongly negative reviews because, in my opinion, the staff run a pretty kickass business here.\n\nLike some others, I also had to wait approximately half an hour after my appointment time to be seen, but isn't that kind of expected at a doctor's office? All of the employees I interacted with were sensitive, knowledgeable, and friendly. I was also pleased to be able to change my prescription from a 1-month to a 3-month supply, which had been an issue in the past with my primary care physician. \n\nBy the time I had left my appointment, a pro-life activist had positioned himself uncomfortably close to the building. He was having a civil debate with a PP employee as I walked by. Fortunately, PP has its own security ready to deal with these individuals if a situation becomes hostile, which I think is tragic.\n\nOverall, I applaud this location for its service to the community! I will most definitely return in the future.","3902966":"I had to go to a select lab to have a urine drug screen done for employment.  Apparently, only certain sites have the ability to process this test so I was unable to go to the my local labcorp that was virtually across the street from my apartment!\n\nThis was the closest option that performed the test.\n\nFortunately, this site is nestled in a little parking lot and I was able to find a spot with relative ease.\n\nLabcorp is not located inside the building.  There is a window clearly marking this as the Labcorp site so there is no confusion.\n\nThankfully, on arrival the office was empty and I was the only consumer.\n\nThe process of providing a urine specimen for a drug screen is, well, interesting to say the least.  The technician had a great sense of humor and was able to laugh about it with me.\nShe also provided me with clear instructions, b\/c like I said it is interesting.  If you do not follow the instructions you will have to come back another day and the sample will not be submitted!\n\nOverall:\nFast and friendly service with a smile.","3904581":"Efficient service with an electronic check-in that scans your ID and a water cooler if your bladder isn't quite up to task yet. The attendant wasn't the friendliest but he did get three of us in and out simultaneously. Be aware however they are closed during a lunch break for 12:30 to 1:30pm.","3904598":"This place is horrible. This first time I came here, I was left naked on the table with the door open for 1 hour while they tried to figure out how to work the ekg machine. They never ended up figuring it out so they told me they weren't going to charge me... like ya I'm obviously not going to pay for a test i never got. I mistakenly made one of the doctors my PCP and now am also having another horrible experience. I had to have blood drawn for school, was told to stop by and pick up the results, I am now waiting here for an hour because this place is so disorganized. The nurse was administering a shot.. walked out of the room with the syringe to get another vaccine, doesn't give me a bandaid and says okay your done. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!","3906473":"What's the point of booking an appointment if you're gonna have to wait for 3 HOURS .","3907587":"Dr. Wilson was super nice. Nurse was super nice.\n\nLocation perfect.\n\nDownside: Very long wait time.","3922737":"Service was fast, friendly and professional. They refunded my money after initial diagnosis because they didn't have certain testing capability, they were completely honest and fair.","3927416":"Why bother making an appointment if you're forced to wait.  It's never nice having to wait and the doctors office.  This is the second time I left work early to bring my daughter here.  We had an appointment and she was called back after one hour.  She's now been waiting one hour to be examined.  If you have insurance go to a regular gynecologist otherwise PP has you at their mercy.","3939091":"This place is the bane of my existence. I need to get drug tested every year for graduate school and every year it's a nightmare. The hours for drug testing on their card say from 10-2pm. However the paper note on their door says from 10-1230. then their website says something COMPLETELY different. They are extremely rude and unprofessional about explaining any of their ridiculous hours. Thank god this is my last year because I will for sure NEVER come back here.","3943649":"I was here about a week & a half ago, and I have to say it was the worst experience I've ever had at a Planned Parenthood center. That's saying alot bc when I lived in NY, I was a PP volunteer & spent lots of time fundraising for the organization.\n\nFirstly, I made an appointment on a saturday for 9 AM so that I wouldn't spend my entire day there. Guess what? Didn't make a difference. I was there until 4:30 pm. Crazy! \n\n\nSecondly, while I was in a waiting room, one of the staff left the door wide open. I was exposed-even though it was only other staff members walking by, it was so embarassing. They should know of all places to be discrete & make ppl feel comfortable. \n\nOn a positive note though, I will say they were really helpful with making my visit there affordable, since I currently do not have insurance.","3944638":"The receptionists need to get their attitudes in check. And I was under the impression I was going for a free visit because of my low income, but at the last minute, after everything was said and done, they sprung a surprise $100 balance at me, which I was unable to pay. There was a huge lack of communication which caused embarrassment to me. They should have told me before I went back and had an exam and medication.  \n\nMy doctor whom I can't remember her name was pleasant at least.\n\nBottom line; only go here if you have no insurance, not alot of money to spend (you WILL have to pay at least $55)  and you have absolutely no other option.","3948443":"Had a great experience today (Monday). I made a same-day appointment through their website. Signed-in at the office and was able to get my labs done about 5-10 minutes after. It's a convenient location too-- just hop off at the Race-Vine station on the BSL. They do walk-ins, but set up an appointment if you can.","3957523":"Let me save you some time spent in this purgatory:\nMake an online appointment at the LabCorp website.\nhttps:\/\/www.labcorp.com\/labs-and-appointments-advanced-search\nDrug screenings are from 10-2pm. Really didn't help that their voice message system doesn't mention the online appointment system first. My first rodeo with LabCorp so we live and learn!\n\nAppreciated the touchscreen check-in process (bring your ID and paper print out) and the water cooler. Otherwise, this is depressingly similar to a DMV with fluorescent lights, anxious clients and frustration in the air; go in with a appointment so that you can be a priority.\n\nWent in on Friday at 10:05am, no appointment, 7 people in front of me and one technician. Name called at 10:58 and finished at 11:03. Total only took an hour, which is a 5 star from me! \nDo it smarter: get a online appointment and leave purgatory sooner to get on with your life.","3961337":"This place is the absolutely worst place ever!! I've been here since 11:30 my appointment was at 12:30  and I still didn't get seen what the fuck is the point of having an appointment? I don't recommend this place it's terrible.","3968259":"It's really annoying that my appointment was 12:10pm. It is now 12:54 and I'm still waiting to be seen! I asked how long and although the receptionist is kind, her response was there was one person in front of me and that some people have been waiting two hours as if that is a completely normal answer. Where on Earth do these doctors go for THEIR needs that they think 2 hours to make someone wait should be understood? Bad business practices.\n\nOther than that, the doctor I previously had there was amazing. Plus the person that takes your information beforehand. At that time I was seen right away. Too bad that experience wasn't similar today","3978506":"Understaffed and slow.  They don't keep appointment times. It is a shame that hospitals outsource blood testing these days.","3979394":"This place is understaffed, the one person working at the front desk seemed impatient and in a hurry to get everyone out. Regardless, it took me quite a while to be seen. \nThe doctor was not personable and was also in a rush to get things done. \nNo one communicated effectively with each other and no one seemed to know what they were doing. I got wrongly charged of a physical and overheard the doctor and front desk receptionist fighting about why I was charged. In the end I overheard the doctor telling him to direct the nurse to then do a physical on me (in order to trick me for paying for it) instead of reversing the charge. \nExtremely unprofessional, greedy, and uncaring staff. Would not recommend.","3991250":"Love this place , Rich at the front desk is always charming , helpful and goes above and beyond .","3994955":"They will keep sending you bills which you've already paid out. PAY ATTENTION!! They sent the bill to the collections without notifying me, and after I paid to the collection, they sent me the same bill again, claiming that I still owed them money. STAY Away from this place!! STAY AWAYYYYYY!!!!!!","3996979":"The most terrible experience I've had. I had an appointment I made weeks in advance. They call me the day before saying they made an oopsie and they cancelled it. Ok, so I reschedule for 12:30. 1:45 rolls around, I'm still waiting. I ask how much longer because I have to get to work. They say \"I dunno like 1 or 2 more hours\". They were unprofessional and just didn't give a crap. What kind of place makes you wait 3 hours after your appointment time?? Why even have appointment times?! I was so upset and I had to leave or risk losing my job. I hate this place. It was my first time going to a planned parenthood for birth control and it ruined my image of them. Never again.","3999999":"This location regularly overbooks appointments. I don't know if they accept too many walk-in appointments are what, but regardless I've scheduled two appointments here, both times waiting over an hour. Both times I ended up having to leave for work before I was even seen because they were running so far behind. I don't have hours of my day to spare waiting around to be seen for an appointment I pre-booked, so I won't be going back.","4003723":"I called Planned Parenthood at 1pm about coming in for routine testing. I was told that the clinic accepted walk ins until 7pm and the test I wanted to have was available. I got to the clinic at about 4:30pm (I was coming from work). I was advised by the young woman at the desk that they were no longer taking walk ins. I was really annoyed because I was assured that I could walk in until 7pm, and I made a special trip. I asked to speak with a Manager and she stated that not only were they not taking walk ins, but the test I was told was available was actually not available. \n\nAfter seeing my obvious annoyance, she stated that she could fit me in for another type of test. I started to fill out the paperwork, but then decided I didn't want to be tested there. I didn't feel safe or comfortable. This is the third negative experience I've had with PP in only two years, so I'm done. The contact center staff is poorly trained and never seem to have correct information. The young women at the front desk are terse and sometimes downright rude\/dismissive. Even the Manager seemed frazzled and less than concerned with the poor services. And this is the exact same Manager I complained to two years before. I really believe in PP's mission, but this location is horrendous. Get it together PP.","4005937":"Came here for my first covid vaccine shot. Super friendly and competent staff- easy check in. I hate needles and had anxiety about getting the shot. The lady that gave me the shot was so kind and patient and good at giving a painless shot. They even had a designated kind hand-holder which I utilized. I'm grateful for a good experience !","4006713":"Very upset and nervous about negligence. Signed up for annual exam here and birth control prescription refill. Made an 1130 appt, arrived early for paperwork. Waited and waited. Had to ask to be seen twice. Finally got room, Was not seen by doctor\/NP until 1242 pm. Did not get annual exam i requested, patient care tech? Cancelled exam and doc just gave refill to me. Upon voicing my concerns, i could reschedule my annual (and what, take off work again and wait for another 2 hours?), but i shouldnt need to because \"annual exams are not necessary for those in their 20s because health problems we screen for arent present? Newsflash, young people can have stis, abnormal anatomy\/physiology, and cancer Glad i could at least get my script but i believe that attitude was negligent. I made that appointment for a reason and i do not believe my history or needs were discussed adequately before this callous cancellation was made and i Hope that this was just a one off for the sake of others who may use this facility for primary gynecological care. Very unfortunate.","4022148":"Worst PP I've ever been to, unfortunately. I asked the staff if there was any way for me to know what my cost for today's service would be so I could make an educated decision about whether I could afford their services under my insurance, and they were extremely rude. I tried to ask as a simple yes or no question--\"I'm not sure how much of your services my insurance covers, so I was wondering if there's a possibility that I'll have to pay additional fees on top of my $20 copay today?\" The staff member just rolled her eyes and kept saying that I'd have to pay my copay today, which wasn't my question, until another staff member said \"what the fuck is this bitch asking about??\" She thought I couldn't hear her through the glass. At least she finally answered my question with a simple yes. Since there's no way for me to know how much i'll have to pay for the service before receiving the service, I ended up leaving. Can't afford surprise bills. My friend also had to pay $120 out-of-pocket and wait 1.5 hours after her appt time for a simple screening, and they were unhelpful and rude towards her as well. Will not be coming back to this planned parenthood.","4022758":"The connection is absolutely terrible. There is no service, no one answers phones or calls you back. They don't call you at your appointment time and when you call them before your appointment time, they disconnect you and ignore your calls. Why stay open if you refuse to communicate with your patients? My appointment that I waited over a week to get was very important to me and I am beyond frustrated and upset that no one has the decency to even call me back to reschedule. Please shut this place down. Not one person is willing to do their job!","4024583":"Great staffs! Came here for my COVID vaccine, everyone is super friendly, especially Linda at the front desk. There was a short wait time too!","4026396":"I was nervous about going to Labcorp because of the low reviews I saw on yelp, however, I just came back from my appointment and I had a very pleasant experience. The phlebotomist who drew my blood was able to do so on the first try (I have small veins, so this is remarkable) and she was also very kind, capable and efficient throughout the entire process. The building was also clean and seating was properly spaced for social distancing. Everyone wore the appropriate personal protection equipment as well. This is a great location.","4027522":"When I went for my drug screen yesterday I was not aware that they had a 2.5 hour window where they only did the drug screen due to COVID and other reasons. Since I came after the lab worker, Trish, told me that they're not doing it during this time. When I told her I didn't know, she talked down to me and told me I should read what's on their website. Which isn't something I would be aware of since the emails I received from my employer said to go during the open hours. Trish then rolled her eyes and walked away from me when I had to go to the bathroom. \n\nAfter going today I interacted with Tanya, and the experience was so pleasant. She provided excellent service and it was clear she had good communication skills. She explained why the window for the screening was shortened and was extremely friendly. As a healthcare professional I had no intention on going back or telling my colleagues to go to this location, but she saved the experience and is the only reason I'm giving this review 2 stars. Trish was just so awful.","4037449":"I will start by saying that I have always had a pleasant experience with the staff here.  They are friendly and generally helpful.\n\nHowever, I have a huge problem with scheduling an appointment, waiting 45 minutes to be taken back, waiting another 30 minutes in the room, then having to leave without being seen because I have work to get back to.  I scheduled my visit for my annual exam and to renew my prescription.  I left and asked that my prescription be renewed, so the clinician handled that.  I then still owed a co-pay even though I was not seen for my actual scheduled reason.  \n\nWhen I went to leave and told them I couldn't wait any longer, they mentioned that since it was lunch time, many doctors had gone on lunch and that's what the hold up is.  I don't think it's fair for everyone to go on lunch while there are patients waiting over an hour for their appointment.  It appears I'm lucky though, I see some people have waited over 3 hours.","4037946":"My appointment was at 12:30, I left at 4:30 pm. The staff was very kind and accommodating to my questions and needs. I understand that they tend to overbook for the benefit of their patients(we all know time plays a huge factor) but I do think there is a need to change their system.","4040178":"We found lice and this being the second time around, with the resistance lice, we needed some help. We quickly got an appointment for the same day. The process was explained very thoroughly. \n\nWe had a great experience, much quicker than doing it ourselves! It isn't a quick fix but it is not toxic and gets the very worst of the symptoms straight away. The treatment plan is much simpler as well. Thank you!","4040624":"They seem to forget about their customers. They don't call you to tell you that your prescription is ready or even if your doctor did not authorize another refill. I also really dislike that they don't give you any instructions or paperwork with your meds to explain side effects, what not to mix with it, etc. the way that all of the other drug store do. Disappointing. I had high hopes for this place when i first transferred my prescriptions.","4046933":"Called ahead and they said they could see me right away. After I arrived and followed all of their registration procedures (out on the street, since they don't allow anyone in the office until their appointment), I was told that there was NO DOCTOR in the office and the staff was not even sure when a doctor would be available. Do not waste your time with this place.","4050882":"I have been to this location three times in the past month and I have not had any issues. The first time I was there for 15 minutes total because it was empty and they saw me immediately. The receptionist actually had an issue with  my paperwork and helped me to call my doctor to get it situated. I appreciated her patience. I was also there this morning and I was about the 15th person to sign in when they opened and it only took about 45 minutes total. They were extremely kind despite the fact that a lot of people were there waiting. I know there are many negative reviews but this is actually my favorite LabCorp so far!","4055652":"The worst Lab Corp location I have been to. They are all bad, this one is by far the worst. Last time I was there, the tech bruised my arm so bad. Its finally almost gone after two weeks. Should have taken a photo initially but didn't know I was going to leave a review. Went back again (why?!) hoping for a different tech to do my follow up work. I arrived at 10am, only one other person in the waiting room. By 10:20, about 10 additional people had arrived, ignoring the posted sign that only 5 people were to be inside the waiting room. Every single one was called before me. They shouldn't have even entered the room!!! Yet the tech still took them before me, claimed they had appts, even though the screen that is clearly visible had the W (for walk-in) next to their names. Also, they took masks off continually. Left without getting anything done because of the incompetence and rudeness of the \"only staff working\" at this location. Will follow up with a manager and corporate if need be. Disgusting.","4056180":"Save yourself and don't go here. In March , I was sent for an ultrasound. ($100 to me) I was told I had a large mass on my right side. I was told i needed to contact a doctor and get a ct scan with dye. Possible surgery. I had to have lab work. Then I had a ct scan. Results -a small mass on my left side. Dr app ($40) sent for more labs. All negative. Ct scan with dye again in 6 months. (Out of network as I do not trust Jefferson) . Ct scan done with dye($275). Everything negative. I have had multiple lab work, dye placed in my body, unnecessary ct scans. Drs appointments again ($40). Jefferson should pay for everything. Should apologize . Should review their radiology staff.","4057977":"Had my worst experience with a phlebotomist at this facility last week. After hitting a nerve in my left arm, drawing blood from my right has left a 4\" diameter black and blue mark.","4065746":"Justin was very kind and gentle with my blood work. The place is very professional and quick to get everyone through as quickly as possible. This is my new go to for bloodwork.","4069670":"I had an abysmal experience at this urgent care for a severe ear infection. Below are the significant problems I had with this place.\n\nSeverely Understaffed - one desk person, one medical assistant, and one nurse practitioner were there for a full waiting room. My wait was 1.5 hours. The person at the desk even said, \"This location is understaffed.\" \n\nFreezing cold exam room\n\nUntrustworthy Care, Dosing Error, Pharmacy Location Error- I needed liquid medication due to inability to swallow large pills, especially with the current pain and swelling I have. Liquid medications have never been an issue for me to get in the past. It is available for the medicine I needed, and is used in adults in some circumstances. The nurse practitioner there took roughly 20 minutes, a half sheet of paper filled with numbers, and a call to the pharmacy to TRY to figure out how to make the dose right. \n\nI am also a nurse practitioner, and was trying to let her know how to do it but she really wouldn't listen to what I was saying. During that process, she stated to the pharmacist that I was a \"46 year old woman who weighs almost 100 pounds.\" Both pieces of information were WAY off.  \n\nShe also for some reason thought she needed to dose the medication by weight in an adult, which is inaccurate. I told her this as well. The 500 mg dose is the same for an adult whether taken in capsule, tablet, or liquid form. It is only calculated by weight in pediatric patients. Liquid form is not exclusive to pediatrics.\n\nI was told by her to take 500 mg twice a day of my medication. It was sent to the pharmacy (incorrectly calculated) as 2400 mg twice a day (30 mL twice daily of a solution containing 400 mg\/5 mL). The correct amount would have been 6.25 mL twice a day. The medication calculations are a simple process of one multiplication step, and one division step.\n\nI called and confirmed with the pharmacist that this was indeed what was sent. I also learned from the pharmacist that many prescriptions coming from this urgent care are questioned and need correcting, and stated they know to look out for it at the pharmacy. That is quite disconcerting. \n\nI am also breastfeeding, so I am not sure exactly what that high of a dose could have done to my baby.\n\nThe prescription was also sent to an entirely different CVS location than I requested, in the opposite direction of where I live. \n\nWhen I spoke to the pharmacist he said he sent a message back to the provider right away regarding the dose being \"really high,\" and had not heard back many hours later when I called. If I were relying solely on this urgent care to fix this issue, it would have produced a huge delay in getting started on the medication for my infection. I ended up having to call my OWN medication in correctly, which is a shame. The students who frequent this location would not be so lucky and capable, and possibly would have been taking an extremely high dose of a medicine unnecessarily. \n\nWhile she and I were in a back room while she struggled to figure this out (and never did figure it out) the waiting room completely filled. As she was the only provider on staff, that is a huge problem. Those people were in for likely a 3 hour wait, and the pressure of this on ONE provider will probably only lead to inadequate, rushed care and more mistakes. \n\nCredit Cards - Their system puts your credit cards \"on file\" without asking or telling you. If I ran into this much trouble with my care, I surely did not want my credit card number on file. I left with zero trust in any one in this place.\n\nI left so frazzled on top of the pain I was in that I was crying, and I am an adult professional woman, who had the means to fix the problems I encountered. I have NEVER had horrible, untrustworthy healthcare anywhere else in my 12 years in Philadelphia. \n\nI will NEVER go back. I truly advise that NO ONE goes to this Urgent Care.","4070759":"Medical Guardian started as a great concept for my father. Until we recognized the system wasn't strong enough to register his falls, despite the extra features paid for. Within two months of use, my father fell several times, with no support calls from Medical Guardian, which in turn led to his brief hospitalization and move to a rehab center to gain strength, and then ultimately to a nursing home.\n\nMonths later, in May 2020, we had to sell his home and pack up all his belongings. Of course, in all this time, I'd forgotten about Medical Guardian, as it wasn't working for him initially, and thus it was out of my mind. Imagine my surprise when I received a subscription bill for another year, for a MONITORING service, that wasn't even aware the unit wasn't plugged in.\n\nWhere was the monitoring? Why wasn't I called or even sent an email that asked about the system not being plugged in?\n\nSo I call to cancel the service, and get a refund, only to be told I need to send back the equipment we're leasing, or be charge $350 for it. How about I get a refund for the 9 months you collected a $45 fee without actually monitoring ANYTHING? That equates to $405 for a monitoring service that couldn't even be bothered to tell me the unit wasn't plugged in and monitoring anything.\n\nYour cancellation customer service rep had the gall to tell me Medical Guardian isn't spying on their clients, as they have thousands of clients and can't do that. Spying?!? We paid you to monitor my father's safety and you couldn't even monitor if your own equipment was turned on.\n\nI will take the time to go through my father's boxes and find your equipment and send it back, so that you don't charge us $350 for equipment that wasn't even working. And I want you to refund me the 9 months I paid for monitoring where no monitoring was done.\n\nI've already contacted my credit card company disputing the $539 subscription charge for 2022. Instead of actually being a guardian of elderly people, your company has proven they are taking advantage of the elderly with a service that isn't regulated (no actual monitoring going on) and is expensive\/almost impossible to cancel without getting screwed over on fees.\n\nMy review rating for your product is zero stars. I'd recommend your company to no one.","4071060":"I've said before, but LabCorp is the Kmart of labs. I only go here because they're in-network and Quest Diagnostics (the Target of labs) is not.\n\nLapcorps are poorly maintained and not run well. For my most recent visit to this lab, I was greeted by a smoke detector chirp indicating it's battery was low. Who knows how long that battery needed to be replaced. After signing in, I noticed there were no cups for the water cooler. When this was pointed out, they only had \"urine collection containers\" to use for water.\n\nI'm stopping short of giving them just one star since my lab tech was professional and proficient.","4074293":"Wonderful service. Nice people. Tyrone was wonderful.  Made a tough morning easy. Thanks","4074992":"Unprofessional.  I'm beginning to think that this is systematic of ALL the LapCorp locations.\n\nMy wife came here over the weekend, and the Lab Tech had CURLERS in her HAIR?  How is that professional.  Is this a reflection of what LabCorp is really about???","4075334":"I was greeted with \"sir it's going to be a while\" upon walking in the door before the gentleman at the front desk even asked if I had an appointment (I did). Throughout my time in the waiting office, this lone employee at the front desk greeted or spoke to other patients very frankly. The guy seemed pretty overhwlemed and the lack of professionalism is probably why. They just seemed understaffed.","4075789":"Why couldn't they notify their customers that they were closing??  All it would've taken was an email, phone call, or letter.  I went to fill a script and was greeted with a sign on the door that all medications were transferred to Rite Aid.","4079776":"This is the second and last time I am going to this location.  It may be close to work, but it's anything but convenient.  I make an appointment only to see at least 2-3 walk-ins get handled first.  It takes at least 15 minutes past my appointment time to get waited on, and another 10-15 before my blood work is done.  The staff is uncomfortably uninterested, and the one phlebotomist smoking out the back door making the office smell of her cigarette was the final straw.","4087073":"I have insurance but decided to schedule an appointment here anyway because I support the mission of Planned Parenthood (PP) and know that have clients with insurance allow PP to subsidized and free care to the uninsured and those who need it. \n\nMy appointment was schedule today at noon and I showed up early. At 12:37PM I went to the window and asked how many people were in front or me or how much longer the wait my be. The representative at the window said, \"Yea, they schedule two and three appointments for the same time so that's what the hold up is.\" When I asked how much longer it might take for me to be seen, they said, \"I can't really tell you. I just put the folder up at the window.\" I politely thanked her and told her to cancel my appointment and that I would go elsewhere. She said okay and apologized for my experience. \n\nIf you have insurance and can afford to go elsewhere, I would suggest that you do. While I understand that the clinic may have a significant number of no shows and overbooks to correct for this, many folks really can't afford (literally and figuratively) to wait an hour or more for their appointment.","4090803":"I almost never write reviews because I don't particularly enjoy doing it.  I've even put off writing this one for about a week and a half.  But I had to come back and say that the experience I had here was hands down the best I've had all year.  And that's saying a lot as I've had a complicated chronic illness for a long time and have a lot of doctor appointments.\n\nI prefer to see my established doctors because of some of the more rare reactions I can get to medications.  Unfortunately, I got an earache and none of my docs had an appointment open for the next three days.  I figured by that time I might be in some real pain.  I made an appointment for the next day through the myDoc portal.  \n\nI showed up on time and the receptionist started processing me right away.  When he found out I had a post-nasal drip (I always have it), he put me in a room on my own just to be careful because of Covid, which I thought was good practice.  The nurse came in within about five minutes and was very friendly and sympathetic.  The real star of this show was NP Cara Caputo.  She came in about five minutes later and was a better listener and more capable medical professional than most doctors I've seen in the last year (and that includes Johns Hopkins).  She understood my situation and tailored the treatment to fit my needs.  I'd say I was in and out in under 45 minutes and by the time I got to the pharmacy, the medication was ready.  \n\nI am so grateful not only for the quality of this visit but also for the knowledge that I can go to this facility for future illness.  It sounds like there might have been some issues at this urgent care at some point, but I'm hoping someone listened to the reviews and that this is the result.  Really fantastic place that I will depend on in the future.","4091893":"My experience here was absolutely horrifying.  I entered the building behind a woman and her partner and followed them up to the front counter.  The young woman said that she had an appointment for an abortion consult.  I stood there as the lady at the counter shamed the young woman, rolling her eyes and making an under-her-breath comment about the girl's visit.  She then told the girl she had to speak to the man at the front door. I was next in line and said that I had an appointment as well. The woman told me to go speak to the man at the door too, so I followed the girl and her partner.  When the girl approached the man at the door, he too was extremely aggressive and cold, telling her that she needed to go see the video.  I was next, and he snapped at me, \"what, you need to see the video too?!\" and I realized what was going on. I said \"no, I'm here for a contraception appointment.\" and he was suddenly a thousand times nicer, telling me to go see the other woman at the counter again.  I walked back up to the counter and the woman said, \"I TOLD you to go see the man over there!\" and I pointedly said, \"It's a contraception appointment!\" and she, too, was suddenly MUCH nicer (although still not particularly friendly.)\n\nTo be unkind to a woman seeking to terminate her pregnancy, especially when your organization is supposed to stand for a woman's right to choose, is unacceptable! I was HORRIFIED to realize that I received much kinder, more friendly treatment when I said that I was there for a contraception appointment than the woman there for an abortion consult. NOT OKAY!\n\nNot to mention, I had a consult at Penn Medicine that PP didn't want to accept. \"Penn refers people here and they really need to stop.\" they told me. Alright, I get that maybe there's an issue that people get consults at Penn and referred to PP, but maybe you should sort that out with Penn, not have patients come all the way there only to be told PP wouldn't do the procedure?  They finally did the procedure after I explained that my insurance was expiring and PP was the only place with an appointment within the necessary timeframe, so that was nice, but that issue should be ironed out.  Also my doctor at Penn mentioned that they often charge for STI Screening that never took place -- I can't speak for this because it didn't happen to me, but keep an eye out.","4098017":"The nurses are angels and have always taken great, gentle care of me. That's what's important.\n\nBut those wait times.... at best, I've waited an hour with an appointment. At worst, THREE. I'd consider myself to be a pretty patient person, but that's a little insane.","4098358":"I absolutely love this facility! The nurse practitioner cara is a phenomenal professional and caring. The entire staff there from the front  check-in to the assistants are all great professionals in their care for patients. The nurse assistant who took my blood was one of the best that I ever had take blood without any issues and not even a drop of blood on my band-aid! The gentleman at the front and the other nurse are very discreet in keeping your personal information protected. Thank you everyone there for doing such a wonderful job and treating your patients so very nice.  Ms. G.","4099069":"The service was fine but when it came time to return the unit and get a refund they charge a 50 dollar restocking fee and it's been a month since the unit was returned and still not refund to the banking account.","4101060":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!Would give them ZERO star if possible...\n\nAll of them are greedy pigs who just want your money and sends you out!!!!!\n\nThey charged me $30 copay onsite but sent me a $280 bill afterwards. \n\nCharged me$164 for a new patient visit??!! WTF!!!\n\nI hope someone will sue them for their BILLING FRAUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nGreedy pigs. Greedy pigs. Greedy pigs. \n\nDo yourself a favor to get a REAL doctor!!!!!! \n\nStay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","4101403":"What a scam. I just found out from my health care provider that they've been overcharging me. Who know how deep this rabbit hole goes in how else they're scamming the healthcare system that's already crippled. This is ONE of the major reasons why the healthcare system is in shambles; because of unethical doctors\/hospitals who charge exorbitant prices with little to no cap for a few minute service. I spent more time in the waiting room or waiting in the patient room than I did to have Dr. Tang give me a look-see and take my blood pressure and body temperature (an iWatch does that too, I came to a doctor for a reason). I received a notice from them that I owed $200 for my visit (3 months later) and that my insurance refused to pay when I pay $300\/month to my insurance. Called the insurance company only to find out that every claim has already been paid out so they didn't understand why my PCP was sending a paid out claim for me to pay. So instead of owing $200, I find out from my insurance company that they've overcharged me on my co-payments. Riddle me that PCP. \n\nUpdate- I spoke with Jing Jing (CFO) and she tried to educate me on the healthcare system and how it's unfair for doctors and how my first doctor visit is free and that the healthcare companies doesn't pay for it, as if I should feel grateful about receiving healthcare, PAID healthcare! Listen lady. Damn right it's unfair. It's unfair that I pay faithfully to a healthcare insurance company that I've used twice this year just to get a look-see and no damn follow-up. We don't need to educate patients on the healthcare system when the patient is trying to inform you of some gross error\/miscalculation on your organization's part.","4101767":"Always friendly and patient\nClean office\nClear instructions, easy check in\nAmazing phlebotomists\n\nThank you.","4102031":"The last time I had my blood drawn here I got stuck four times before a vein was hit and I still ended up with a hematoma that filled the inside of my elbow. Today I had my blood taken and was stuck three times b fore a vein was hit and again a big nasty swollen hematoma. There is a man named Justin there that is very unprofessional . He said really rude things to me, like it was my fault that they could not draw my blood. He even told my daughter who was with me that he was sorry to hear that I was her mother. Direct quote, actually said that.","4107650":"If you have the choice between going here for an appointment or getting birth control from a witch doctor... give the witch doctor a chance first.","4113028":"If you're looking for quality health care\/health care providers...this isn't the establishment to go to.  From the front desk staff (Rich) wearing gloves...and using hand sanitizer to sanitize his hands (...who the heck even does that?! Doesn't that kinda defeat the purpose of wearing gloves...?) to billing that doesn't know what they are doing (apparently billing issues are a common theme - make sure you hold onto all proof of payments if you get a bill from them...cause you don't know if they'll send your account to collections) and of course Jing Jing.  I didn't know her name at first, had to ask the medical assistant.  Made the mistake of asking if she was always like that ~ going on a tirade...and just plain obnoxious\/rude.  The assistant just looked embarrassed as to how management was acting.  Thankfully I was only there for a sinus infection, so I wasn't there too long (and didn't have to listen to Jing run her mouth).  But once I was outside...decided to do a quick google search.  Go figure ~ lots of complaints regarding billing\/collections; staff (voicemail always full; rude; unprofessional; etc); and the icing on the cake ~ a lawsuit.  Apparently a former employee had her hours cut due to being pregnant (guessing it's a civil rights\/discrimination lawsuit).  Thankfully the sinus infection cleared up but I learned a valuable lesson - stay away from this facility for care.  This is Philadelphia - so many options for healthcare, go where the staff is genuine - and truly cares about their patients.  Skip over myDoc.","4113970":"THIS PLACE IS HORRIFIC. Having to make the toughest decision of my life as any woman who has been pregnant in a situation of any unhealthy circumstances, I scheduled to have an abortion here. I got there at 8:45 my appointment was at 9. There were two women ahead of me. Let me state the legal limit for abortion in the state of PA is 24 weeks. I was nowhere near that but in my second trimester. I was taken back for an ultrasound about two hours after I got there. 4 hours later I finally saw a doctor. There was so many girls who arrived after me who were in and out. This was the most excruciating, shaming, terrible experience of my entire life. Waiting for 6 hours to have the doctor roughly do a vaginal exam, take me back for a second ultrasound, be verbally aggressive with the ultrasound tech in front of me all while I am sobbing hysterically on the worst day of my life. No one here had any compassion. The doctor refused to perform the procedure saying I was \"too far\". He tapped me on the knee and gave me a number of another doctor he said MIGHT do it but he would not. 6 hours in what feels like a dungeon filled with women included myself sobbing having to make this painful choice. I have supported planned parenthood my entire life. I had thrown a fundraiser through my salon this past year when PP was being threatened to close to help raise money to keep their doors open. This was a scarring experience and I hope if you're reading this you choose to go elsewhere where you will not be shamed for your decision and will be handled with respect and care.","4124249":"I actually had a really great experience here at Labcorp this afternoon. I scheduled an appointment online and although I arrived early, I made it back to get my blood drawn right on time. The phlebotomist was extremely nice and apologized for the wait because they were shortstaffed, but I didn't mind. The blood draw was quick and nearly painless. I'll be coming back for my next blood test!","4125144":"Amazing service, nice staff, professional.. Can't say enough about this place, I recommend anyone who uses a different pharmacy (esp. Big chain RX) to go to First class!  So helpful with any questions an\/or concerns!","4131501":"Had a shocking experience this morning.  While having blood taken at a Center City, Philadelphia LabCorp in December - when deaths due to Covid are at its highest, my nurse asked me \"Have any plans this weekend?\"  I said \"No, Covid has limited my social life.\"  She said \"I'm not letting Covid limit my life.  The cases are nowhere near what you hear about otherwise all drug addicts would be in the hospital now with their compromised immune systems.\"\nAre you kidding me???  She's in the healthcare profession and she thinks Covid is a hoax!  I'll never go back to that location, ever!","4135332":"I am having a major and unresolved problem with Medical Guardian. My father in law recently lost his wife and wants to stay in his home and he is a fall risk and has a heart pump. We researched medical alert companies and helped him choose and he signed up with Medical Guardian earlier in August - The Classic Guardian. He does not want to wear a necklace - he only wanted a wrist band. When the system arrived, the wrist band that they sent was not the design that is shown on their website for the Classic Guardian. Instead of having a metal buckle at the end like a belt, it was all silicone and to fasten it you have to push two little silicone prongs into two holes. The one they sent is a very bad design - you can not push against an old persons arm to push the silicone tabs into the holes, and you can't put your finger behind it to push them in, as that pinched my father in law when we tried to do that, so we had to put it on very loosely which is not ideal, and then it fell off. We tried putting it back on several times and it kept falling off. The only system that shows this style of wrist band is the Mobile 2.0. I called on August 16 and was transferred to the department that takes calls if you want to cancel your membership after the first lady on the phone tried to just blow me off and tell me that we must have received the wrist band that comes with the system we chose, and that turned out not even to be true, so when I told her that if they could not send a better designed wrist band we would have to cancel our service, and then she transferred me. I spoke to Robert Sullivan who told me to call 800-313-1191 to talk to him directly if we had any future problems or questions and he said that he was going to send out the other style wrist band the next day - the one with the metal fastener at the end as is show on their website. The post date shows what the package was mailed three days later and we received it approx. August 22. When we opened the package we found out that we were sent the exact same silicone wrist band, and also a necklace\/pendant that my father in law does not want and we never asked for. I called again on August 24th and had to go through the problem with the first person who answered the phone and then get transferred to the other department again - (They said that Robert Sullivan was on another call and not available to speak with me). A lady (I did not get her name) listened to our problem and she said (as well as the man who I spoke to first said) that the design of their wrist bands must have changed, and she was going to reach out to management to see if the wrist band style with the metal fastener is still available - if they had any in stock. She said that she would get back to me by phone in the next two or three days and let me know what she found out, and as of today, four days later, I have not heard back. I looked on the website today and it still shows that the silicone band is what you get with the Mobile 2.0 system, and it still shows the band with the metal fastener should come with the Classic Guardian. We have not been able to use the system at all so far, and we are lucky that my father in law has not had any falls. I don't understand how Medical Guardian can have such good ratings when the customer service that we have received is so poor, and when they even have such a bad design of a wrist band with the silicone one in their inventory - they need to get rid of that wrist band asap.","4137801":"The staff at this LabCorp is so RUDE. The first thing I need to mention is that they had their masks pulled down under their chins in a medical facility. The bathroom was out of order and I stead of anyone showing me where to go, I got half-assed directions and got an attitude when I asked for clarification. I still couldn't figure out where to go and I walked passed another employee with their mask down who snapped \"Where are you going?!\" at me. After using the bathroom there was nowhere to was my hands. I was never told where to wait after using it and had to wonder around to find someone and got the same attitude I received when looking for the bathroom.","4139264":"This is a VERY unprofessional office. The clerks talk about their poor credit scores and that they are in collections while patients are waiting to be checked in to get blood work. Seriously, this actually happened more than once.  I  can be the only person there and still wait 20 minutes just to check in!  My last visit, I signed the clipboard and the clerk said have a seat. She started reading email and made me wait 20\" before she called me back. She then told me she was tired and wished no one came in for the rest of the day.  While she was inputting the information, she kept talking about owing tons of money and not being paid enough by Lab CORP. She proceeding to say they were a terrible company and to never get a job there. I told her she didn't need to worry about me ever working there. She then asked me if I wanted to put a credit card on file in case there was a balance my insurance didn't cover.  After listening to her and her coworkers discuss their poor credit ratings and the fact that they both are in collections, I wanted to dig right into my pocket take out my credit card and hand it over to her so she can input it into the computer.  Yeah, I  think I'll pass!!!!!! If my insurance didn't mandate that I go to Lab CORP for services, I would never utilize this company-ever.  Unprofessional all the way around and a serious risk for identity fraud with these deadbeat employees. I don't trust the safety and security of Lab Corp at all.","4141317":"The WORST!\nMade an appointment a few days ago for a Saturday morning. I woke up at 7 AM (on my one day off) in order to get there on time. While being checked in on their computer, the electricity goes out due to their use of  portable heaters. They closed and I never got my blood drawn! Also went there a year ago with an appointment, they were packed. I waited appx. 45 minutes and never got my blood drawn because they weren't even close to calling me, even though I had an appointment. Will never go here again!","4142684":"I am very impressed to say that the director of PP reached out to me to discuss my visit. I am so grateful for that. Catherine explained that the wait was so long on Saturday because of unforeseen circumstances with a clinician, so they were one staff member down. She apologized that patients were kept up to date with the circumstances and given the option to reschedule. \n\nI am pleased that Catherine took the time to get in touch with me. It was a kind thing to do, and I feel more at ease with the services I received. \n-------------------------\nI'm such a huge advocate for Planned Parenthood services and would really like to give more stars. I genuinely believe in the message of planned parenthood, and as a MSW candidate I refer many clients here, which is why I decided to use services myself. \n\nThe staff were kind and helpful for the most part, but the appointments are a joke. In order to get an iud out in and my implant removed, I had to have three separate appointments. I understand appointment time is limited, but it would have been a much better use of their time, and certainly mine to do them in the same appointment. The first appointment I waited 45 minutes after my appointment to be seen on a Saturday. On a Monday I waited an hour after my appointment and was this late for work after getting the IUD put it. I asked them to take the implant out then because I did not want it in any more and they said they wouldn't because the IUD wouldn't be 100% effective. I said I would abstain from sex and they still said no. That is not trusting women with their health care and I was incredibly upset by this. I am in charge of my body and my reproduction.\n\nI am currently at my appointment to get the implant out. The appointment was schedule for 11:30. It's been over two and a half hours of sitting here waiting without a word on when I will be seen. As the sign on the door said no food or drinks, I haven't had any water since I came in at 11:20. This is completely unacceptable. I will be very blatant with clients in the future when referring them to this planned parenthood. Clearly too many appointments are scheduled in a day, and that needs to be fixed. This would not be the norm over weeks at a clinic in a hospital and I genuinely believe that because PP serves generally poor women that this is why it happens, and that women who have access to only Planned Parenthood care get less of a say in their health care than their wealthier counterparts, and also receive lesser care because of their income status. That is not okay, and not what PP stands for. I'm terribly disappointed and disillusioned.","4144334":"Justin is horrible!! The man who is working there and taking blood needs a different job!!! I came in there was waiting around 30 minutes because both machines were down to sign in. He threw the clipboard at me and just seemed very aggressive and very bothered. He's patients are all older people and me being a very young adult by myself did not feel comfortable. When I went back there he was the young man taking my blood. I know I came in for lupus bloodwork so I knew it would be a lot. He did not seem pleased at all!! Very unhappy and bothered, he was literally throwing stuff around and acting in a manner where he seemed angry. When he took my blood he jammed it into my left arm and when he realize he did not put it in correctly he moved the needle in my arm!!!! I have had a lot of blood work done and nothing seems to bother me, or I thought because I started bawling my eyes out in his seat and he waits until he was done to ask me if I'm OK. I waited two minutes and then asked for his name politely he was so upset and rude. He was the only gentleman in the room and I asked for his name and he said are you speaking to Me and I said yes he gave it to me and I asked for his last name he did not provide it. I told him I wish you had a good day because he seems like he's not he said because he was here and working. Basically implying that he would not have a good day. With that type of attitude he should not be working and taking peoples blood. He also said this in front of his next patient who was an elderly woman.I know during the pandemic we are shorthanded but all I was asking for was kindness and gentleness. I work two jobs and I'm a young female so I had to get it done but I will never come back. He does not deserve his job There are people who actually want to work.","4147974":"The reviews really match up. Overall, they get the job done. The clinic isn't glamorous but the staff are friendly enough. Lots of errors with patient info, my name and gender were wrong with tests that were ordered for me. This feels like something that needs to be tightened up, especially for submitting insurance claims. I didn't have to wait more than 20min for my appointment.","4148391":"My favorite pharmacy.  Knowledgeable staff, very friendly, willing to go the extra mile for customers and efficient in every way.","4151646":"This will be my new go to urgent care center. Each staff member was EXCELLENT! In and out in about a half hour. I cannot explain how helpful and professional they all were. The office is clean and neat. There are surgical masks and light refreshments in the well styled waiting area. I am thoroughly impressed and pleased. Kudos","4152747":"Absolutely horrendous customer service and blatant refusal to send cancellation documents timely therefore impacting the amount of money supposed to be returned to us.  They are in effect holding on to over $500 due back to us. These wait and see tactics should be illegal. This feels very much like theft and predatory behavior against a vulnerable senior population.","4157134":"Very unpleasant experience overall. My mom went there for a Covid test. Because she doesn't speak English, she was received by a woman who speaks mandarin. That woman was so rude and impatient, she basically just threw the testing kit to my mom and then walked off without giving her any instructions on how to use it. My mom had to ask for help from other patient who just did the test, you can imagine how hard it was for my mom. After receiving the test kit back from my mom, this woman refused to answer my mom's questions on how do we receive the results and walked off immediately without any words. I understand that people might have a bad day but this could not be the reason that you treat your patient so badly.\n\nThe bad experience didn't end there. After waiting patiently 1.5 days after the test, we still haven't gotten the result from LabCorp portal, so I called the mydoc office and was told to wait for another day. on the next day when i called, I was put on hold several times and no one answered me the whole time. So I had to take a day off from my work and walked to mydoc university location with my mom to ask them in person and only until then they could tell me that there was an issue with the paperwork that was processed by mydoc staff and this was the reason why we couldn't see the result from LabCorp portal....It appears my mom's name was input wrong by mydoc staff. They somehow was able to give me a paper copy of the result but refused to give me the electronic version of the result which I need to submit to the airline for my travel which is the whole purpose we are doing the covid test! And the worst part is they tried to cover their own fault and never gave us an explicit explanation of what really happened.\n\nOhh, and forgot to mention as well, when we called the office to make the appointment, we were told the testing fee is $175 if we pay cash, but on testing day, that woman charged my mom $199 even if we pay cash and this rude woman refused to explain for why there was an extra charge and of course didn't give my mom a receipt at all. The lack of transparency with MyDoc University location very unprofessional, on top of the staff's bad manner and material errors in processing paperwork.\n\nIn the end, I just feel very frustrated why we paid money to buy such an unpleasant experience at all. Not recommending you all to go there from my own experience.\n\nUPDATE - I checked with LabCorp directly and LabCorp gave me the feedback that they were unable to locate a copy of my mom's report within their system. I am very confused if LabCorp doesn't have our record, then who processed my mom's covid test. It was also suspicious that Mydoc Urgent Care was unable to provide me the e-version of my mom's covid test result. All we got is just printed out paper result with my mom's name spelled wrong on it. I would appreciate if MyDoc Urgent Care could contact me and give me an explanation if the test was really processed by a lab and how it was done w\/o leaving a record in LabCorp system?","4157941":"Officially the worst blood draw I've ever had. I always offer my left arm after some not so good blood draws from my right arm way back when when I didn't know I should specify. After effects ceased to be an issue after that since I have an easy access vein in my left elbow that every prior phlebotomist has used while leaving me completely free of after effects.\n\nNow, with something of an aversion to needles, I never look while the phlebotomist is doing their thing, I just try to mentally distance myself with all my might. But two things broke right through that veil at this location.\n\nFirst, the phlebotomist seemed to have missed her workout that morning and decided she was going to make it up by tying the tourniquet on my arm as tight as she was physically capable of. And she wins the contest of the tightest that one has ever been tied on me to be sure. It is without a question not a contest I would ever have consented to though.\n\nSecond, while the pain seemed higher than normal, with me and needles, that can be psychosomatic, so I'm still pushing on to my mental scape beyond. Then she switches the vial she's drawing into. There were two switches, and each were another contest win for her as the most jarring any phlebotomist has ever been while doing that. It was not exactly something I could phase out of.\n\nI walked home clutching my arm the whole way wondering what the heck happened in there and, here's the call back to me never looking while the phlebotomist is doing their thing, realized upon taking my sweater off at home that she had also decided to challenge herself by trying a different vein.\n\nIt probably goes without saying her \"bed side manner\" could also use work.\n\nPictures attached for reference, bruising picture taken 10 days after the blood draw.","4158326":"One bonus star for the place being clean, nice, and relatively efficient. In addition the nurse who did my initial forms, etc., was fantastic and very friendly. But that's where the positive ends.\n\nThe real problem here is Dr Wilson. To preface, I've been going to the Chestnut street PP for years and it's been a great experience, but they've closed so I came to Locust for my yearly checkup. Everything was good until the doctor came in. She spoke down to me like I was an idiot, and treated me like she thought I was a terrible person for electing to stick to the recommended Pap smear schedule instead of getting one that time. She also refused to write a prescription with enough refills despite me having taken the medication this way for 10 years and never having had a doctor, I am serious, yell at me for taking it in that manner. In fact, all of my previous doctors have prescribed it for me without question. She \"couldn't\" and now I'll have to go in a second time this year incurring another copay.\n\nIn short her bedside manner is terrible, she shows very little respect for the patient, and is ridiculously condescending. She made a face at me when I explained why I take the medication. It's a shocking contrast to the other staff I encountered there and my nurse practitioner at the previous PP I went to.\n\nI like the convenience of PP but I'm going to have to seek out a new doctor after being stuck with Wilson at this location. Avoid her if you can.","4162343":"The product is fine but the customer service is terrible. It took 3 weeks for the company to acknowledge a return. The return was received, a credit was issued and then I was billed again in 3 weeks. I would not do business with this company again.","4168903":"I have been coming here for MANY years.\nJustin is amazing.  He gets blood on the first try and painless for me.\nVery nice place and very efficient.","4171227":"Spent over an hour waiting at this location and was never even fully checked in. In the entire time I was there only one person (of about 15 people) was called back to do their testing. Waited around for the receptionist to return to the front so I could at least get the order my doctor had faxed in so I could go elsewhere but she was missing for about 55 min out of the hour I was there. This location is dirty and slow and I wouldn't recommend going here for labwork unless you have a few hours to waste and there are no other options available.","4171242":"I won't go into detail about my experiences with Planned Parenthood but I'll say it was pretty good.  I heard many people in the waiting area complain about the front desk people being rude, but they were nice to me.  I think I'd be rude too if I had to deal with some of the characters that come in there on a daily basis.   The receptionist forgot to give me my paperwork to fill out when I came in but once she remembered I felt like they saw me asap.  My appointment was free because of my income and they even helped me fill out paperwork to help me get low cost coverage in the future.  I called 3 weeks ago and specified that I needed  a Monday appointment so it didn't take that long to be seen.  All in all I am happy with my services here and would recommend it to any woman my age who needs low cost\/free care.","4172319":"I would give them a lower score for bedside manners but they saved my life so a 3 rating is fair. I had surgery on 6\/24.......I stayed overnight and the pain was unbearable but they took care of me there and the overnight nurse was excellent.  I then started to hold my breath every time I dozed off which made it extremely hard to get any sleep.  The next day I was asked if I wanted to stay an additional night or go home and initially I said I wanted to go home.  But as the day proceeded and the pain did not subside when asked again by a student doctor I said I would like to stay due to continued pain.  She said fine and she would tell her team.  Then the day nurse came in and told me I had to get up and walk because I was to be discharged that day.  I told her that I had already spoken to someone about staying an additional night and she said she had just spoken to the doctor and I was being discharged.  I was walked to the end of the hall and then a female doctor from my surgeons office said she was happy I was getting around and I was ready for discharge....I told her my pain was excruciating and she said it could be managed from home.....I asked if I could stay another night and she asked me how was home and I said fine, she asked me if I had food and I said yes, how humiliating.....at that point I was done protesting. I have insurance but clearly the black patient only wanted to stay another night due to issues at home and food insecurities.   They discharged me home with 10 pain pills after a double mastectomy with expanders and 4 drains........I am sure this is not something you would normally do.....10 pain pills to manage my pain at home......I wonder how my stay and discharge would have gone if I were not an African American female!  The nurse said she called transportation for a wheelchair to take me out but after 40 mins I chose to walk out which was painful but I had a ride waiting the whole time!","4173015":"The phlebotomist hit a nerve causing nerve damage. Still in pain several days later and my PCP says it could take weeks or even months to heal. Go elsewhere for your blood work, the phlebotomists here are not experienced.","4180495":"I arrived at 10 on a Tuesday. There wasn't anyone waiting in the lobby. I was met immediately and courteously at the front desk. I was able to go straight back and was out by 10:20. The phlebotomist was kind, fast, and perfectly competent. I had a very pleasant experience and would highly recommend this location.","4439832":"Walked in at 10:57am, 6 other ppl sitting in the waiting around but only 3names before my name on the list. The worker was alone and overwhelm because it was close her lunch break. She was not friendly nor welcoming. This is the second time I've been here and there has been one worker, but the other lady was so fast and efficient that I didn't mind. But I won't be back here unless it's another tech person working.","4659067":"This is the laboratory collection location preferred by Parx Casino for prospective employees. After the initial interview at the casino, they hand over a large manila envelop with the proper Quest Diagnostics form for completion, signing, and to turn in to the Quest personnel for processing along with a urine sample. \n\nIt is not the most efficient operation, but they get you in and out as quickly as possible. There is a sign-in tablet for registering your presence, which seemed to work when we were there. The employees didn't have bubbling personalities, but they weren't rude, either. Just another day of handling blood and piss for them. \n\nAt the end, they keep the forms and samples, and send the results back to Parx within 24 hours in most cases. \n\nIf you've had illegal drugs in your system in the recent past, these tests will show them, and the job will be forfeit.","4670912":"Staff are rude to patients, lady with an accent gets frustrated when speaking to elderly patients. Understaffed","4676644":"It is insane how literally slowly you all work. I have been to the quest diagnostic in jenkintown and they are quick and efficient with all patients. You must be just standing around 90% of the time.","4712738":"They literally don't do anything. A waiting room full of people and no one being called back. You can hear them talking in the back. No one is out front to talk to you.  They have the nerve to put a sign out that says \"we are doing our best.\" Other locations run quicker than this. I was told a 20 minute wait for drug testing and it's been an hour and still no one called me back. Not to mention this place smells. Not very sanitary.","4713838":"Waited 3 hours this place is horrible the sign they have in the front has misspelled words and they are rude people the nurse didn't wear a mask I am calling the health department on them!!!!????","4724320":"Whether on the phone or in person, the staff is always open to answer my health related questions, which makes every experience pleasurable. Myra (the owner) is very helpful and knowledgeable about the products and is overall health conscious. There aren't many affordable vitamin shoppes in the area, and I'm happy to have stumbled across this gem.","4739125":"My body was feeling out of wack and Myra the owner was able to tell me some things I was deficient in during a consultation. I was able to purchase a 7 day colon cleanse that she recommended and I lost 10 pounds. I also purchased some other vitamins and herbs that she recommended which has helped tremendously with my issues. My primary doctor just told me it was anxiety and to take magnesium. I am thankful to Myra for going more in depth and helping me to feel normal again.","4749874":"This is going to sound like such a random review. lol After eating a at place nearby with a friend, I was complaining about how stiff my joints felt, and that I was feeling tired half the day and unmotivated to exercise. My friend immediately said, \"We're going to see Mrs. Myra right now since we're a block from her spot.\" I was like, \"Yanno what? Why not...\"\n\nWe walk into Myra's and she was sitting there smiling. She looked up from her computer, looked right in my eyes and said, \"Well if thi isn't the body language of a restless and stiff person, how are you, today?\"\n\nI was like, \"Whaaaaaaatt?! You can see that!? Are you real??\" Mrs. Myra laughed and I proceeded to explain my joint issues and tiredness that my doctors couldn't figure out over the course of a year. She asked me how much I weighed and aks how long I'd been this weight. I told her I usually walk around at 205 but I definitely put on 25 pounds over the last year. She said my joint pain was likely due to lack of vitamin D, my body adjusting to the new weight, and I need to turn my phone off at night and lay down instead of using it to put me to sleep. Sheesh, she was dead on. \n\nI purchased some vitamin D at 5000mg from her, and got a little more active again with my fitness regimen. Within a few weeks, my stiffness significantly decreased and I've been getting more sleep by keeping my phone plugged up and reading a book like she suggested. I can't believe she solved in an hour what I couldn't figured out in over a year.","4753966":"I went In to drop my dads specimen and the African American short hair with glasses on Monday 3\/2 @ 12:30 pm was the rudest and unprofessional person I have ever met in the medical field . She needs to be looked at by her supervisor\/Administration.... I cursed her out after her treatment .. will never ever be back ...","4814573":"I had to wait for over an hour even though I made an appointment ahead of time. And even when finally it was my time to be seen, the technician took in someone whose appointment was after mine. I'm really frustrated!","4838875":"Phlebotomist staff are very upbeat courteous accommodating, empathetic and professional and  keep me calm. they are very caring and I barely notice any discomfort. they all deserve high praise!","4861448":"I stopped pass Myra's Vitamin Shop for the first time last week. (I'd recently went to the doctors because of some health issues I'd been experiencing. I was prescribed some meds and I'm apprehensive to start pharmaceutical meds) I'd had Myra's card in my wallet since mid summer, but hadn't gotten there until recently. \nI met Myra the owner and she was amazing. I was pleasantly surprised of her knowledge, expertise and professionalism. I was thoroughly enlightened by the time I left her shop. She pointed me in the right direction and provided the needed assistance in managing my health. \n\nI know she thinks I didn't take her advice. But thanks to her I'm consciously balancing my health. \n     I still don't know how she knew *Exactly what health issues I was having just by looking at me. I didn't let her know how on point she was, but I'm Soooo glad I finally visited her shop. THANKS MYRA!! You're the BEST!!","4862583":"I did a phone consultation with Myra. I had different health challenges that needed tending. See told me what I needed right away. I brought the herbs that I needed. And she told me how to take them. I felt relief and changes in a few day. I should have been on an herb regiment a long time ago. I also had to make some dietary changes. Because of Myra I am on my way to better health. I thank the Creator for her being here and for giving her the knowledge to help those in need.\n\n\nJohn C.","4881686":"I've been using The Art of Medicine for several months now. They have been great. Fast, reliable and great customer service. I would highly recommend using them!","4887937":"The sales agent at this store was horrible. I spent hours researching exactly what I wanted. When I got there he constantly tried to change my mind, insisted that I buy GNC products instead of the one I wanted, pointed out the most expensive products they had, and only offered me a discount after I made a purchase. The worst part is that I was supposed to have about 2 hours to work out, but after being thoroughly confused and having to look up reviews in the store I only had about 30 minutes left. I have purposely avoided this store when shopping for supplements; his loss for being so aggressive.","4905674":"This place is a hidden gem. Tucked away at the end of Chestnut Square, it's easy to walk past this place and not realize it's there. I've visited three times in the past couple of months and have not been disappointed. The quality and freshness of ingredients are great. The staff is also very friendly, especially the two girls that have served me.","4906984":"My wife has raved about Fuel for years, especially the South Philly location. So I decided to give it a try. I went to the University City location a couple of times now. I know the whole premise of the restaurant is everything on the menu is under a certain number of calories, but the chicken is sooo dry and the wraps that I got were beyond bland. They also charge $3 for extra veggies, which honestly I couldn't even tell the difference.\n\nSo, I don't know if the quality varies from location to location, but the University City restaurant left little to be desired.\n\nOn the plus side, their smoothies are delicious.","4930849":"Healthy options, solid food, quick delivery!\nOrdered the Thai rice bowl and some chips and salsa- no they don't go together but they tasted very good on their own. Bowl portion was big, fresh, tasty and I couldn't finish it. Some fresh herbs would have topped it off and sent it to 5 stars. Salsa and chips delicious as a snack for late night. Surprisingly the chips were out of a bag and didn't appear house made. GF yes, but not house made. Yes I would absolutely order again when I am in University City and feel good about what I ate!","4939833":"I got a sweet potatoe rice bowl. I had high hopes since I had one at the center city location and it was really good. But sadly when I got my Bowl here, the rice was very under cooked, they barely gave me any chicken which I had to pay extra for, and the it was very dry. Did not have the same flavor as the one on 13th and walnut. I was so upset I had to call the manager back and she had to comp my bowl for me. I won't be going to this location again","4954372":"Went here not expecting much for a healthy \"fast food\" option on a Sunday afternoon. Immediately able to order a roast turkey wrap on an iPad interface where you have to dodge extra toppings and meat options like whoa. We added a protein buster shake and roasted veggies for a ridiculous like charges were added after the base roast turkey was ordered. The wrap was small for 11-12 dollars and the added veggies was and absolutely weak add on portion. The \"mixed greens\" on the side was an after thought and pretty disappointing for a place that would pride themselves on healthy fresh experience. The only silver lining was the shake as it was a tasty addition to the meal. I would consider going back for a shake, but not food.","4959772":"I order from fuel in center city three times a week.  Tonight I accidenyly ordered from this one through uber eats.  Worst decision ever. The Bbq pulled chicken bahn mi was suppose to be over a salad.  What I received was dry, cubed chicken with a side of bbq sauce with a gingerly sprinkle of see-through shredded carrots and microscopic red onions and jalapenos.  Vietnam should smack you all upside the head for disgracing the good name of Bahn mi.\n  The rice bowl my poor hungry boyfriend ordered was barely half full and contained only two pieces of chicken. At $12 that's despicable.\n   Lastly the lettuce wraps came with enough chicken to fill one piece of lettuce.  The cup, which is usually packed to the top from the center city restaurant was sadly filled only half way  with half of it containing this disgusting water the chicken was soaking in.  \n       DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS FUEL. IT IS A JOKE.  \n  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go make dinner, because after wasting $40, we are still starving.","4967454":"I ordered their acai bowl through uber eats, and while the taste was ok, it was literally like eating a bowl of fruit soup. Not worth the price, and definitely would not describe it as an acai bowl.","4981849":"I have been to this location several times, and each visit has been worse than the prior! Two employees in particular are extremely rude and unprofessional -- complaining about customers, on personal calls with several people in the store, and pretty much doing anything possible to make commission off of you. It's ridiculous. Here are a few examples:\n\n-I was buying whey protein, and was told that another brand which was twice the price \"has less carbs and sugar\"...when in reality it has MORE. Do you think I don't know how to read a nutrition label?\n-I was told Quest bars were mix and match for box value, so I did, and then was charged the individual price for each bar.\n-I was heavily pressured into buying AT LEAST 15 different products within 5 minutes of being in the store, in which I left empty-handed after being told I could use a fat burner.\n-I was told that I \"must not be dedicated to my fitness goals\" because I choose not to use countless supplements.\n-Employee tried to force me to drink a sample of BCAAs... out of a personal shaker cup... and after I declined I was questioned 5x as to why I didn't want it.\n-Employee tries to persuade every single customer to join their rewards program or upgrade... which I actually do already have an account. So when I mentioned that I wanted to use the $5 credit I earned, they could not figure out how to apply it to my transaction. Why are you promoting something you don't know how to use?\n\nThese are just a few of my terrible customer service experiences, and will be my last... as I am taking my business elsewhere.","4984227":"Smaller location then others but very good food and fast service. Staff are friendly and always willing to answer questions about the menu","4987684":"Really disappointing! I was nearby so I thought instead of going out of my way to Sweetgreen I could get a decent salad here- I was so wrong. I ordered the Chopped Salad. It wasn't chopped and they barely even MADE the salad; they put the dressing on the side, not on top. If I wanted a bag of lettuce with chickpeas thrown on top I would've gone to the grocery store- and spent a lot less than $8. Don't waste your time here if you want a good salad and a quick meal.","4988228":"I came here before work for a routine blood test for a new primary care physician, and although I had an appointment and they allowed someone to go ahead of me (which is kinda BS), the phlebotomist was gentle and friendly. If I was still working in South Philly, I'd come back again.","4990603":"The decor and people working in the place are both great. Very vibrant and friendly and the service was really quick. \nThe food is so so. I ordered a small Chicken dumpling soup and BBQ Chicken Bahn Mi on a whole wheat wrap.\nThe size of the wrap was good and it comes with a small side of mixed greens and balsamic vinegar. My sandwich was just ok. Nothing really special. There's a whole lot of flavor happening, not all of it bad but not all of it good. I wish I had more descriptive language but I'm just uninspired.\nThe soup, good gravy...actually it was more gravy like. They could really thin it out a bit. Its very lumpy and thick in consistency. The small cut veggies and reddish chicken screams pre-packaged\/canned, but there's a home-made kind of flavor to it. Perhaps, the dumplings cooked down too long and it thickened up the soup, I can't tell you. I've had soup with thick, hearty consistency that avoid being lumpy.\nWould I go back, probably, but I may venture a bit further in search of something else before heading back to Fuel.","4991866":"I developed a really bad skin condition that 3 dermatologists couldn't figure out. I tried upwards of 10 different creams and pills. I heard about the pharmacy through a friend and called to see what they could offer. The pharmacist, Jack, gave me 15 minutes of his time to discuss what was going on. He recommended a special topical compound that they have been making for years. He even called my dermatologist to discuss the treatment. 1 week after getting the gel, my skin condition completely cleared. I could.not.believe it. I'm so grateful to have a solution to something that I've been suffering from for a while. Thank you Art of Medicine!!!","4996831":"I came in the other day to grab lunch and was blown away at how friendly and helpful the staff was. the young guy at the counter was extremely patient with me when i couldn't decide between the pesto tbm and the bbq chicken bahn mi. he recommended the tbm, which i got and was extremely pleased. it was delicious and i'll definitely be coming back for another!!","4997292":"Amazing customer service, very impressed with this pharmacy. Jack and his team were able to clearly explain the pros and cons of my particular order and filled the order quickly with easy to use instructions. I will definitely be coming back here for all my future orders. Plus they're able to fill orders for pets which is a huge plus for me","4999317":"I ordered the hummus with vegetables and the sweet potato fries... The fries were barely edible, they were mostly burnt, black and cold by the time I got them. I honestly ended up feeding them to my dog. When I received my hummus and veggies, there was only three pieces of Cucumber and 4 pieces of peppers. The lack of care in preparation of the food alone would make me never order from here again. I've always enjoyed Fuel in South Philly but I won't order from the one in University City again.","4999819":"The smoothies and juices are great, but I would avoid the sandwiches. I just ordered a chicken Gorgonzola panini and it was barely toasted so the bread was soggy, the chicken was too think for a pressed sandwich, and they put SO much salt on the tomato that I couldn't eat it. Definitely not going back anytime soon for lunch.","5009806":"I stopped using Quest years ago, but had to change doctors who used another service. I received several huge bills, some with dates & tests made up, like 4 thyroid tests in one day!. They said they wouldn't take my insurance - Medicare! Who doesn't take Medicare? I wrote letters, phoned & got nowhere. & in the end they sent me to a collection agency, where I was able to negotiate a much more reasonable settlement - $500 instead of $800, . Medicare, of course, said they lied flat out about not accepting it.","5018754":"As a previous medical assistant in a podiatry office and current student at Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine, I have had the pleasure of working with the staff of the Art of Medicine in regards to supplying patients with various topical ointments. Their professionalism and dedication to their customers is outstanding - absolutely a group of people willing to go the extra mile for others!\nThe prescriptions are always filled in a timely manner and patients are well informed of the products they are receiving and instructions on use. I would highly recommend this pharmacy to anyone!","5019365":"Extremely underwhelmed by this experience. We went there to participate in the University City Dining Days deal. When we went up to order we were told that in order to do this, we needed \"cards\" for Dining Days, but the store had run out. This made zero sense because we were also told that we were the first customers to come in for Dining Days. So we had to walk to another restaurant, pick up these useless cards (really just ads for Dining Days), come back, and give them to the cashier, who didn't even look at them. They were out of a few options of food, but didn't bother to mention that to us until after we'd ordered, even though we'd been sitting at the tables for quite a while beforehand. After ordering, I stood at the register, just waiting to pay, and was completely ignored for about ten minutes. There were eight or nine customers in the entire place and 4-5 employees, so I don't see why this was such an issue. The food itself was okay, but after having to substitute my initial order, I wasn't totally satisfied. They have good options and I would try something else there another time, but probably at the Center City location where the service was MUCH more friendly and quick. If they're going to participate in something like Dining Days, they need to be more welcoming and knowledgeable of how the system works.","5024212":"I'm no expert when it comes to vitamins however this is where I come to get my vitamins and oils. \n\nThe space is always clean and cool as you enter. The agents who are knowledgeable beyond my scope and expertise greet you with a warm and genuine smile. I've come here a few times and I love their products. During my last visit, I found out that the store brand is twice tested which is super awesome! So I trust the namesake for that reason. \n\nToday I came in to purchase essentials to make a DIY shampoo and conditioner. As I transition to a completely natural texture I want to put natural and organic products in my hair. So I decided I would learn how to make an organic shampoo and conditioner. I'm a novice so I came here to be educated on the oils and their differences. I learned so much about cold pressed oils and heated oils. Cold pressed will give you the most of what's in the plant based product for example rosehip. I learned that with heat you can lose a lot of the natural attributes. \n\nNevertheless I found everything I needed here. Ms. Tara is amazing, kind, and intelligent and not in that order  She answered all my inquiries and she helped me locate all eleven items I purchased. I'm especially glad I came today because it was BOGO. I saved at least $25 \n\nThanks for the personal, professional and friendly service Tara I greatly appreciate!!!","5028437":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. We were dying for a drink. \n\nWe were intrigued by the iPad ordering system. We both ordered smoothies with almond milk, mango, banana and strawberries. \n\nThe smoothie was average. It wasn't very good nor interesting. It was around $4.20 for a small one. Definitely won't be back.","5032261":"Staff is very accommodating and pleasant. The food is good too though I took a star away bc they got rid of the salmon. Otherwise it's perfect!","5035827":"I like this place because it is quick, convenient, and healthy. If you are looking for low-calorie, healthy, varied food, this is a good place to go. I loved how I could practically customize my wrap which even came with a salad! I had a whole wheat wrap with smoked salmon, avocado, veggies, tomato, and mozzarella.The only issue was that there isn't much indoor seating and you don't get waited on, so I would recommend taking my food to go.  I can't wait to return and try something different!","5038532":"Horrible customer service, noone greets you, very slow with making orders, and it seemed like the people working here were confused about what they were exactly supposed to making even with order tickets. I ordered an acai smoothie that tasted like the grape nyquil my mother forced down my throat when I was a sick kid. When I told them that, they acted like that was what acai was supposed to taste like with attitude and didnt offer to correct the situation. Save your money and your time.","5047135":"Bad food. Soggy fries. I know they're baked but no excuse for them to be mushy. They tasted microwaved. The quinoa and black bean burger was nothing special. The strawberry tahini shake got separated and really just tasted like milk blended with frozen strawberries. Overall extremely underwhelming and overpriced food.","5062084":"Worst salad ever! Ordered the shrimp and avocado shrimp with no onion. The greens were yellow, half of the avocado was black and of course they added onion in the salad. Very disappointed for a $10 salad! Would never go back again! Rather go to sweetgreen for the same price with quality of good! Now I understand why everything is under 500cal, because you need to get rid of half of the portion!","5082187":"Always a pleasure to speak with Jack and the rest of the group. By far the friendliest Pharmacists I have had to speak with in the Philadelphia area. You can tell they are passionate about helping their patients and they feel very much a part of the patient's care instead of just a supplier\/distributor of medications. Definitely shows in their work and interactions.\nMost importantly, from a Veterinarian's perspective, the compounded medications work very well. Have had a few patients that were close to the end and just adding comfort with some compounded pain medications helped a bunch. Sometimes that allows a bit more time for the family to spoil their pets and spend some time before saying goodbye.\nThank you Jack and team!\nDr. Brad","5087709":"After hearing about my first experience, the manager quickly responded offering me a complimentary meal. I redeemed that today and ordered what I would have ordered had it been available last time. The food happened to be much better this time around as was the service. Thanks especially to Demetria.","5105054":"Follow up to my previous review. I wanted to give Fuel a second chance and I'm glad I did. I got the white bean escarole soup and a greek salad. The soup was hearty, flavorful and gave me a good feeling inside.My salad was good and it wasn't drowning in dressing, which sort of defeats the purpose of a salad. Well done!  Just In, I had a couple of the sweet potato fries. YO! YO!! Very good flavors, although, they don't travel well and weren't crispy, it is easily overlooked.","5112797":"Great selection of products with a very friendly and helpful staff if you have any questions. If you don't need help then they let you be which is always nice as I hate having someone breathing down my back while I'm shopping.","5118247":"The food here is average, but they offer a lot of healthy options. I work right around the corner from this place, and it is nice to have a healthy and convenient option available. They ran a promotion back in April, and I was one day late, and the manager honored my coupon anyway. The staff I have encountered are all very nice. The computer system that is used to order your food is not as easy to operate as some other places like Wawa.","5119628":"I ordered a wrap yesterday. It was inedible. I am hoping the business owner will reach out to me. I've attached photos of the entire wrap that was doused  in pepper and salt. Covered, every inch, in black pepper ..this wasn't on the list of ingredients and surely was a mistake. So disappointing for a $15 UberEATS delivery.","5139103":"Good spot if your looking for something quick and on the healthy side. I was able to customize my order which is nice because I'm really picky. I'll definitely be back.","5140730":"I'm so excited this new location opened! I've heard of Fuel and have been wanting to try it and I'm so glad I did. The concept is great especially since healthy is so hot right now. You can be in and out of this place quickly and get a tasty low calorie meal.  The service was on point, very helpful and it was super easy to order my meal.  The salad I ordered was fresh and delicious. Sorry I ate it before I could snap a pic :) I went during lunch so it did get pretty busy but I guess that's a good thing! I just used the opportunity to take my salad and enjoy the weather while I ate. They even have charging stations for the few minutes you're there while you wait for your food or if you choose to dine in. In my opinion the pricing is typical for what you're getting. I mean this isn't McDonalds folks! If you're looking for a yummy healthy meal definitely check out this hip new spot!","5142212":"Got the ginger chicken rice bowl. It was so disappointing...the chicken is dry, sparse, and cut up into the smallest pieces. For $13, it literally was jut brown rice a few pieces of ginger and some frozen red pepper pieces tossed in. The chicken to rice ratio was also so off. You get like a pound of rice and maybe half a chicken breast. Also the ginger sauce tasted like nothing. If you go here, definitely stick to a sandwich or salad. Heard those are much better though the chicken will always be dry so stay away from that.","5160333":"FYI: You order and pay on tablets up front and everything is packed as \"to go\" with utensils and even a mini salt & pepper packet. Their plastic containers are also pretty nice. Like you can totally wash it and reuse it.\n\nWHAT I GOT: Gyro chicken rice bowl\n\nPROS: Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size of the meal. Since everything they offer is supposedly under 500 calories, I was expecting like a bite sized, mini bowl of food but it was actually a decent sized meal that left me pretty satisfied. The flavors were pretty ok, the yogurt sauce being my personal favorite, and they gave a hefty portion of chicken. I mean granted, their flavor combinations were all classic and safe. The mini packet of salt and pepper was also pretty nice to have so that you could season your own food. \n\nCONS: For starters, the rice was mushy and the chicken was beyond dry. The yogurt sauce saved it a little bit but not by much. It's also way expensive for what you get. Like on a normal day, I wouldn't even think about paying $12 for a meal. Everything was just okay. It wasn't like super good but not bad either. Completely lackluster and average. But for that price, definitely not a regular stop for me.","5160750":"Ask for Stefan!!  He was extremely helpful.  I went in looking for something to help strengthen my fingernails, but wasn't sure what to get: Iron or Biotin?  He was very courteous when he asked if it was ok if he went and looked up a few things for me.  When he returned, he explained that I might benefit more from a Vitamin B-Complex supplement.  He also suggested that I talk to my doctor before trying Iron, as it is easy to overdose on.  Biotin was a better bet.  By the end of my visit, I had learned a few things (ie: Which supplements are fat-soluble vs. water-soluble, and that there are 1,000 micrograms in 1 milligram). \n\nI asked if he was in college for nutrition.  He said no, but the staff takes classes to be more knowledgeable.  He was very proactive with my questions, and also pointed out their \"Buy 1, Get 1 Half Price\" deal which saved me $4.00.  I really appreciated these things as a customer.  It's a very rare trait for someone to have so much pride in the quality of service they provide!  While you're there, be sure to also thank him for his service in our military!","5164409":"Food is average and overpriced. Not the worst if you're in a pinch and need somewhere to eat, but wouldn't be my first choice.","5168182":"I was excited to check this place out today as it just opened in University City last week. I asked some of my students who had already visited what they thought and they told me \"don't get your hopes up\" and \"the food is really 'blah'\". Well, I'm 2\/3s through my Deconstructed Guacamole Salad w\/ chicken and can say they are sooooo wrong. I guess asking the opinions of a bunch of college students who are used to eating chicken fingers and cheese fries for 5 bucks at a food truck wasn't the best way to survey this restaurant. Sure, it's a bit on the pricier side, but I'm fine with paying the added premium for fresh, organic and healthy real food. \n\nMy salad was made with arugula which had a wonderful spicy bite and was perfectly complimented by the lemony citrus jalapeno dressing and the cool fattiness of the avocado. The red onions, black beans, cherry tomatoes and salsa added that extra freshness that had me gobbling the whole thing up faster than I intended. Oh and the small sprinkling of chips were an awesome crispy surprise. \n\nI loved the fact that you order from a kiosk like at Wawa; that really helps prevent order issues and truly expedites the process. My take? Don't go here if you're looking for a giant, cheap meal. Go to Fuel if you're looking for fresh, healthy food to fill you up without making you feel like you ate a bowling ball. All in all, I'm really excited that I all I have to do to feel good about myself at lunch is to cross the street :)","5172016":"I never heard of this establishment until my Roxie was diagnosed with Cushing's disease. These guys are the best! Wish my CVS was as nice an experience. Keep up the good work guys. Tony Lombardo","5174439":"This pharmacy, as well as the staff are beyond incredible!!  Not only customer oriented but extremely knowledgable.  I have 2 meds that require compounding on a monthly basis;  all I have to do is call and my prescription is ready within 24 hours!!  I recently traveled to Greece and they assisted me with ice packs and the timing of my med refill as the month would be up while I was out of the country.  In essence, I highly recommend this compounding pharmacy...and I'm a health care provider.","5175548":"Great food and really great staff. I enjoyed the bowls, the paninis and the smoothies. Fuel is a good healthy alternative","5177067":"This was my first time ordering from Fuel (through UberEats)and I have to say I was very pleased. I ordered the Tofu bowl and Avocado toast. The flavors were spot on and the portion size was great for the price. The food was fresh and hot and I would definitely recommend Fuel to anyone who wants to try a healthy option.","5178286":"The layout of this place can make things difficult when you're showing up at peak times. Good luck also finding a seat!  The spinach artichoke dip was great, but not worth the cost. The food is quite pricey so understand you may drop $15 on lunch.  There is an app for Fuel that allows you to get $2 off your meal the first time you use the app... unfortunately they don't have the scanner to use the app (at least that's what a worker told me). I may come back when in the area.","5178795":"If your looking for something relatively healthy and fast than this is your spot. Serving sizes are a bit on the lighter end. Their model of ordering is efficient and completely computerized. Very small restaurant and not a lot of seating.  I would suggest getting this to go. \nAll in all it is a solid choice but by no means unique.","5183688":"I got the chicken gyro bowl--the main base of the bowl is brown rice, and most of mine was over cooked, and crunchy, sadly ruining the dish. they also barely put any chicken in which is disappointing since it was over $12. interested in trying more here but definitely wouldn't go for anything rice based again","5194900":"I recently had a compounded Rx sent to another pharmacy in NJ that was very expensive. Since I wasn't really sure if it was going to help I didn't see the point. I happened to cross The Art of Medicine one day and figured I would ask about it. The price they quoted was HALF of what the other pharmacy would have charged and they even promised to transfer and fill it the same day. I decided to give it a try and, wow. The Rx worked great when nothing else did. The service here is great and the prices are reasonable. They were so accommodating and give that old school local pharmacy feel. Highly recommended!","5195658":"Might just have been the food I ordered, but my chicken TBM was deeply mediocre (mozzarella wasn't fresh, tomato wasn't ripe, came with balsamic dressing instead of balsamic glaze). Quality was subway-esque, and while I don't mind subway I certainly wouldn't pay just under $10 for it.","5196125":"Hmm, this place has a great fit and pumped vibe inside, for sure, but I kind of question how this place is health based. Yes, the calories are something, they have a pretty decent selection, but I guess the ingredients are the best? Although, they do have a lot of customization available. I went there for the smoothie and I built my own, there weren't a lot of options at all. The smoothie my mum had was overly sweet. Tasted ok, but not the best nor the healthiest.","5200100":"Amazing phlebotomist (Update: her name is Chelsea!), super efficient, polite and more importantly a very clean facility. Much better than the one on walnut street in terms of wait time as well.","5201692":"I've been to this store plenty of times to get supplemental vitamins. This particular experience was very beneficial.\n\nI came to the Vitamin Shoppe after completing my workout at the gym and after talking with my sister who is a bodybuilder, I decided to take some of her advice and try to get some bang for my buck when completing my workouts. I decided hey maybe a girl like me can try to build some lean muscle and increase my protein intake.\n\nAfter talking with the helpful sales guy he was able to educate me on different protein shakes such as whey and hemp protein as well as amino acid shakes. He enlightened me on what shakes are better for muscle recovery.\n\nOverall I left The Vitamin Shoppe more informed about fitness and also with a variety of sample protein shakes to try.","5202850":"We had the kale salad, guacamole and veggies, the protein buster and the a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl. All were very good!","5206163":"I've been going there a bit and each time food was super awesome! I got the combo dealio and the panini and salad  was super dope. Soup was pretty decent too! Service was great too! Like everyone's super chill! Shoutout to Joseph! Dudes So nice!","5220303":"I am a bit of a health junkie. I typically stop here about once or twice a month to restock my vitamin supply. This Vitamin Shoppe is pretty big and has a huge selection of things. They even have different kinds of tea, soaps and lotions. The sales staff are courteous and always ask if you need help. They also know when to leave you alone and let you do your own shopping ! I can appreciate that because I hate being bothered in a store while trying to shop.\nI also enjoy the healthy chocolate and aloe vera drinks they have in the front of the store. Also, parking here is easy ! There is a huge parking lot. Its in this small shopping center where the Acme is. There is a fair amount of shopping to do around here. Here are just a few stores that are in this shopping center there is a Qdoba, Jimmy Johns, Michael's, Foot Locker, Five Guys, Olive Garden etc., Come check this place out !","5220783":"I really picked this place because it was one of the nearest and healthiest deliveries on postmates. There was a very minor issue with the postmates app telling me that my order would be cancelled if i didn't update the change. I couldn't see the change on my computer and so i called and spoke with Dave and he gave me some troubleshooting suggestions and offered to call postmates if I was unable to resolve the issue. I was able to resolve the problem and I really appreciated his patience and help. The delivery came sooner than expected, which is always a plus in my book. I had the quinoa black bean burger and the Detox drink. The burger came with a nice-sized side salad (which I was not expecting, so that too was a plus). I had never been to a FUEL and did not know what to expect, but obviously I had expected too much. The burger was ok, but it didn't seem like anything other than a previously frozen patty spruced up with avocado, onions and spread. I wasn't a fan of the bread, but the overall taste was ok. Now i did love the fact that they wrapped my drink cup so as to avoid any spillage, that was very much appreciated. However, the drink itself tasted like a fountain slushy and it was super sweet. I guess i didn't realize that this was a fast food place, I rarely eat fast foods. But it served its purpose and the interaction helped to make it an ok experience.","5223402":"Might seem like an unconventional thing to review a fellow pharmacy owner, but it seems like something I have a far more relevant opinion on than food or wine...and the holiday spirit has moved me. Since I opened my own pharmacy almost 3 years ago, I've found other independent pharmacists to be overly petty and insanely competitive, often to the point of being deceitful. Jack and the Art of Medicine have proved the complete opposite. Jack has been willing to help patients 'in need' get vet compounds or prescriptions that I unfortunately didn't have in stock or couldn't get in time. He has always provided thoughtful and timely service, whether its to me or anyone I've referred to him.\n\nI would far rather recommend someone looking for a pharmacy go to a knowledgeable independent, such as the Art of Medicine, and keep the corporate giants aligned as my true \"competition\". Art of Medicine is a just that, and I'd highly recommend them for someone looking for a pharmacy.","5231428":"My beloved 19 year old cat developed hyperthyroidism. Unfortunately, he is also not great at taking oral medications. Companion Pet Hospital suggested a transdermal alternative. Art of Medicine has been patient and thorough with their explanation of dosages. They were very kind, understanding, and worked with me in reformulating the medication to the volume I thought would work best for my cat.","5232703":"Had a wonderful experience here, the manager that I visited was super personable and provided exceptional service. I highly recommend you give this place a visit if you're in the university city area!","5236336":"Before Art of Medicine, I really didn't know what a compounding pharmacy was. Jack (the owner) is incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to not only explain what a compounding pharmacy was but also how it can help me with my issues. \n\nI have tried over the past few years to cut out excessive medication. I no longer take oral contraceptives, I avoid NSAIDs and other OTC pain relievers, and I generally try to only put whole foods and substances into my body and avoid as many artificial and processed things as possible. The Art of Medicine not only gets this (most other pharmacists\/doctors look at me like I'm some hippie dippy crazy person) but believes in this approach as well. Jack was able to get me exactly what I needed without resorting to NSAIDs and other nasty things that I was trying to use to self-medicate. Jack checked in and followed up with me on my condition the way you WANT your pharmacist too. I asked Jack PLENTY of questions and he always took the time to answer me and make sure I was satisfied. \n\nIf you want a specialized and personalized approach to YOUR problems, not generic ones, then I suggest you check out The Art of Medicine and speak with Jack. It is empowering to take your health in your own hands and Jack is there to help you with that!","5245883":"Product is often out of stock. There are some nice workers, there are some that aren't - ( some need improvement with customer service ) the one one located downtown is very professional and well stocked !","5261076":"As I'm learning the ropes to become a health and wellness coach, I'm seeking out local smoothie shops I can get a few tips, tricks and pointers from so of course I had to check out a place called Fuel! The first thing that came to mind when I strolled upon it during one of my lunch walks was, \"What a way to keep me fueled on my walks!\" They are genius, right? Lol. Outside there's seating so that you can catch a breeze, catch up on social media, people watch or enjoy the scenery from the Drexel Campus across the street. The small charming shop offers self-service touchscreens to place your order. I opted for the Smoothie Fest cup so that I can take advantage of the refills since I HAD planned on returning. However, once I tasted it, something was off.  Not sure if they used water or too much ice but my Wake Me Up smoothie was almost flavorless. It tastes as if it was made with powder and not the bursting flavors of real fruit. The interior is coffee shop-esque with seating almost on top of each other. They do have a bulletin board for businesses, upcoming events, etc. for people to post things. The inside was clean but I can't say the staff was attentive. A few of us had to ask if the drink on the counter was ours. I will return to see if maybe it was the smoothie I chose. I also want to try the food before moving on.","5272558":"So.... first off I usually shop at vitamin shoppe & I when you read this review you probably will too. So GNC Loves to fill my inbox come shop with us, we've lowered our already waaaay too damn high prices etc. So I have been going in there bc it's close to home. Everything that I use is significantly more expensive at GNC vs Vitamin shoppe (or any other supplement store for that matter). So they salesman and manager always try to sway me to buy it from them by saying \"bro, we will price match and beat it by a dollar\", cool. As of lately they have a new-ish manager who also keeps pushing the price match same narrative. So I go there to get my item (that has been price matched ever time I come bc that's their way of \"stealing me from vitamin shoppe\" not to mention I buy it monthly) and I ask her \"do you guys still price match (when in fact I know they do and\/or are supposed to) bc I was just there 3 weeks ago for BCAAs. She says yeah, the proceeds to give me a hassle about it bc the price of the item is $8. But vitamin shoppe's price is $6, not a big deal but it's the principal.. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU RANT AND RAVE PRICE MATCHING & BEATING VITAMIN SHOPPE BY A DOLLAR!!!!!!! Not only was I not feeling Jen's overall attitude and lack of trying to gain\/keep a loyal customer, but also she was making fun of a previous customer (who's wife didn't want him spending $40 at expensive ass GNC) saying \"it's only $40 bucks dude...that's not professional. And who the fuck are you to judge him and his wife - TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER. Not cool Jen. I also noticed she didn't have a ring on and I can see why. Anyway, I will be making my way to vitamin shoppe from now on. GNC is  waaaay to some-timey, pushy, expensive & overall unprofessional.","5273636":"I went out of my way to visit the Locust Street Quest after reading some unpleasant reviews of other locations. Very glad I did - I was in and out very quickly, and the phlebotomist Chelsea was great. It was one of the easiest and least painful blood draws that I have had.","5282890":"Real juice. Real flavor. Real ingredients. This place is the real deal. I've never had a juice with the actual pulp inside. And the team is dope. Louis and crew are the bomb.","5286388":"Health is wealth! The Vitamin Shoppe carries some awesome supplements, vitamins, minerals, teas, drinks and more to address almost any health need. I just love learning new knowledge when talking to the health associates when I have any questions; they're very nice and informative. \n\nThe store is always clean, bright and neatly organized. Also, the store return policy is very reasonable if you are dissatisfied with any product. Great place!\n\nHappy Healthy!","5288325":"This food is literally amazing. Highly recommend the avocado toast. I crave it a lot and have to force myself not to order it every night! Great pricing for such fresh and delicious ingredients. The a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl is very good too. I wish I lived closer to this place!! Love the concept. Wish they would open a location at Temple University.","5293890":"This pharmacy is amazing!! Its unlike any pharmacy I've ever been too... I heard about it from a friend and decided to stop by. The pharmacist Jack (he owns the place!) talked to me and explained what kind of things he does which is good bc when i walked in i wasnt sure i was actually in a pharmacy haha. Ive been dealing with chronic knee and back pain for a few years and i haven't found anything that really worked for me. Ive tried just about everything...extra strength tylenol, ibuprofen, meloxicam, naproxen, diclofenac and every over the counter cream on the market! Most of these drugs work really well but taking them long term has some devastating effects on your body! My doctor tried to get me to start taking tramadol and vicodin but i cant handle the nausea and drowsiness that comes with these and i just didnt want to go down that road. I explained all this is to the pharmacist Jack and he thought he could help. He got in contact with my physician and discussed previous treatment regimes that ive tried. A couple days later i went to pick up my own personalized pain cream! Theres several different drugs all in one cream! Nothing like this is available in your typical pharmacy...after a few days i stopped taking my oral meds and this has become my mini miracle! I highly recommend this place to everyone! Couldnt be happier with the professional care, respect and service i received from my new pharmacist, Jack","5297669":"Ive had pain in my knees from running and exercise wearing them down over time and I've finally found a solution. \n\nJack (the owner) is wonderful. He helped me pick out a cream that would not only be pain relieving, but muscle relaxing and an anti inflammatory. He confirmed it with my doctor and after ONE NIGHT of use, I woke up feeling better than I have in years of physical therapy and NSAIDS or painkillers. \n\nThe cream Jack prescribed is fantastic. I can put it on when I'm feeling pain and won't have to deal with the drugged feeling of pain killers. I don't have to use it when I don't have pain and its fast acting and straight to the point when I do need it. \n\nAfter years of seeking treatment for pain from runners knee, I'm proud to say I'm pain free!!! \n\nThank you Art of Medicine!!","5299702":"I never really write reviews, but the turkey burger was like rubber and was ready in about 2 minutes from when I placed the order.","5321453":"Sometimes I have to get something tested at a lab. The someone's at Lab Corp aren't the friendliest folks. On my last trip here, they wouldn't start my test because I came too close to closing time.\n\nSomewhere else, would be my suggestion if you could. Lapcorp is basically like Walmart. When you're there, you really wished it was a Target. Quest Labs would be the Target of lab work. But they're out of network and I have to go to Lab Corp.","5332544":"Usually have no problem here but today was REAL annoying. I was the only one in the restaurant and they managed to give me a completely different burger than I'd ordered. Had to go back and get it replaced. Left again and finally got to sit down to eat and there was no god damn avocado. If I walked back I'd be late for class so I went without that very important and expensive ingredient, which is probably my favorite part of the whole damn thing.","5335646":"I could rant for weeks about the pathetic nature of this store. Incompetence is almost tolerable, deceit disgusts me. Both the staff & manager lie about their products. Avoid this store\/chain at all cost. Order online.","5344007":"My friend took me here for smoothies and we both ordered smoothies. The lady gave us both extra 16 oz of what we ordered and said she didn't want to throw away extra. Thank you for that! Will definitely come again soon. \n\nThe one in pink was apple juice with mango, raspberry and strawberries, along with protein. The other one was the same but pineapple juice. \n\nI took one star away because of air circulation.","5346518":"I Came in Friday morning, was at Pearelmen Center dropping my aunt off, so I was starving and remembered they opened up one of my favorite places I used to lunch with my coworkers at when I worked in center city, so I decided to check it out! OMG it was beautifully done, and omg fast! Super friendly staff, fresh and tasty food and Exactly the \"fuel\" needed for my long day of errands! thank you I'll be back next week!","5348444":"I have nothing but positive things to say about my multiple experiences with Dr. Jack and The Art of Medicine. You won't find a more accommodating, caring pharmacy anywhere.  And I'm not just talking about Philadelphia.  I have since moved to Georgia and have kept The Art of Medicine as my compounding pharmacy for both myself and my pets.  Since Dr. Jack is licensed in GA (and I believe multiple other states), I am able to get top notch medicine and customer service from basically across the country.\n\nIt is refreshing to finally have a pharmacy and pharmacist who treats me and my pets as if they are family.  I highly recommend The Art of Medicine and I don't see myself ever going anywhere else for my family's compounded medicine.","5349238":"Best lunch spot in town! Real food that actually comes from the Earth like brown rice and kale with tofu and Korean BBQ sauce in a bowl that's absolutely delicious. The people who work there are consistently helpful and considerate. They also have a huge selection of smoothies that are fantastic. My favorite is called protein buster, it's got banana, honey, possibly some other fruit and you can add an energy booster to it or even creatine. Overall it makes me so happy that I can find quality, healthy food quickly and affordably at an easily accessible place in the city.","5352258":"So if my picture a few months back wasn't enough, they tried it outdo themselves today...\n\nI come up to the door about 10 minutes ago and it's locked but there are people in there.  I first thought, \"maybe he's getting robbed\".  I checked the window, nope.  There are two customers.  The guy motions to me to hold on.  Minute or so passes and the one customer leaving let's me in.\n\nThe guy at the counter apologized and says, \"my manager is late and I have another job to get to so I locked the door hoping to not get any more customers.\"\n\nBruh...\n\nI understand that situation being in retail at a point in my life and knowing the struggles but come on man, that's bad business.","5355504":"Quest's 803 Locust St location should be renamed \"Chelsea Diagnostics Lab\" because Chelsea, who is the primary phlebotomist there, is exceptionally good at her her job.\u00a0 Moreover, her \"people skills\" are unparalleled. Regarding those patients who might be a \"tad nervous\" about having their blood drawn, Chelsea is both compassionate and reassuring.\u00a0 Last but not least, she operates and maintains an exceedingly clean laboratory.","5360545":"The mango lime smoothie was actually pretty good; refreshing and not too sweet. However, the baked sweet potato fries were soggy though the flavor was good and the guacamole with charred corn literally looked like the corn can straight out of a can. Just okay overall","5366971":"I hate to review businesses poorly, but... when all of your food is canceled and the drink, the one item left, is wrong.... well, there's not much positive one can say.\n\nBascially, I didn't receive my order... except for an iced coffee. The iced coffee was supposed to have sweetener and cream, but... yeah, no. Neither. Lesson learned, I suppose. Fuel Uiveristy City ought to be avoided.","5367548":"Update 17Apr2013:\n\nIt's been over a month now and I couldn't be more satisfied with the product!  My knees feel GREAT! \n\nI get to use this cream only when I need it, and it delivers!  Awesome remedy!","5373378":"Paid almost $130 for a test. No results or contact from Quest. Can't get through by phone. The message form won't send my message. The chat is with a robot that of course can't understand. Ridiculous!\n\n6\/17\/20 - and no response from that email address. Do the right thing and refund my $130.","5375680":"i wouldn't even give them one star .. but yelp makes you! do not go to this urgent care!!!!!!!!! they need to shut it down asap!!!!!!","5383972":"Please let us give half stars, Yelp!\n\nSee my original review in the attached photo. DO NOT use Quest for Covid antibody test. And I won't use them again for anything. They have stolen my money.","5384165":"I'm so thrilled that a place like The Art of Medicine exists in Center City now! Being able to approach pain\/symptom management in a more holistic way is really important to me, and I'm definitely against chronically medicating away problems that should be dealt with at the root. However, I know that acute things happen, and AOM has been really vocal and educational about managing pain safely and sustainably. Jack (the owner) is really passionate about his work and is great at educating the public on the value of everything from the aforementioned pain management (targeted topical creams vs. chronic use of gut destroying NSAIDs) to targeted supplementation and bioidentical hormones. \n\nMost importantly, you can't beat the level of caring and customer service you get from a pharmacist that really understands your symptoms and lifestyle and is as excited as you are to see you feeling better and living optimally.","5400270":"Anytime you go in you'll be handed a z pack. I was sick as a dog a week and a half later. Turns out I had allergies. Went back (+150$ later) and was told they fired the Dr I had seen. After explaining I was in PT they gave me an antibiotic that then increased my risk for rupturing\/tearing tendons, and then I tore a tendon. Do not go here. You will medically do better avoiding this place.","5401189":"been meaning to try this place and had opportunity after my recent haircut. I love it that they have so many Vegan\/Vegetarian options. You can have Rice Bowl, Salad Bowl or Sandwich. I had the 3rd: Wheat Panini Eggplant and Goat Cheese. Very good. Comes with Salad greens and balsamic dressing. They also have Juice\/Fruit Smoothie\/Coffee Bar. Employees were friendly and food came promptly. I will go back and I do recommend to friends who try to eat healthier. Prices were reasonable.","5402881":"DO NOT GO HERE. I went this past weekend for a simple Covid test. I didn't even walk in the main waiting room, just stood in the vestibule as I checked myself in. I was mistakenly charged $70 for this \"visit\" even though I have insurance, and this location is in network with my provider. I should've been charged zero, and when I called to speak with someone about this mistake, the employee was trying to tell ME how MY plan works when she didn't even have my insurance info. She ended the call by saying \"whatever dude\" and hung up. Real professional! I gave better customer service as a 16 year old working at a gas station. Also, the day after I had the test I was having issues with the portal, and i tried calling this location multiple times throughout the day on Monday- no pick up, no voicemail set up. Lastly, the receipt they gave me has the wrong urgent care address printed on. What a pathetic excuse of a place.","5405325":"I just thought that I would update this review... I feel like it's been so long that I have been going to the Art of Medicine, for my Guinea Pig, Snickers, and his medication works so well, that I think he'll need it as long as he lives, which is going on 6 years this month!  We were originally referred to the Art of Medicine by one vet, and then when he moved away, it took us awhile to find our current vet who we adore, but I feel like Jack and his team have gotten to know me and Snickers really well!  Snickers' medicine, called Potassium Citrate dissolves urinary crystals, which could possibly develop into stones untreated, so this medicine has meant a lot to Snickers, having had a very high concentration of that one point, and now having no issues on his last ultrasound!  Snickers is a healthy little guy for almost 6 and I really think that this medication has helped him be healthier, and possibly live a longer life! \n\nI was so impressed by this pharmacy that I tried out a pain relief prescription for myself, a cream for my knee!  It really helped my pain!  \n\nJack, James and the team are really great!  I wish that I could get all of my prescriptions here!","5407211":"Wish I could give a 0 star rating. My guacamole which was $8.59, was just completely rotten. I ate through the corn which was the first half of the bowl, and tried to pick around the rest, but the bottom has completely browned and I feel extremely sick.","5416510":"I love this compounding pharmacy!  We've been getting our cat, Ma Jollie's meds, made into a treats for years now.  She absolutely loves them and it makes the usual task of giving cats medicine from a nightmare into an enjoyable (for her) and easy (for me) process.\nEveryone at The Art of Medicine is so nice and easy to work with.  I would highly recommend for any special medicine needs, both human or animal.","5417893":"Look, I never eevverrr post yelp reviews because it feels really obnoxious. People have bad days at work, it happens to everyone and it's totally understandable. That being said, I gotta say this was the absolute worst lab testing I've ever had. The phlebotomist was really rude and mean from the beginning for no reason and made it a point to be nice to her co-worker in front of me, so clearly she wasn't just in a mood. She completely mangled my arm--I get blood tests all the time and I'm not afraid of needles but this was really bad. She jabbed me and jerked the needle around and then ripped it out, slammed the tape on and let me go. When I took the tape off a few minutes later, it was soaked in blood and there was a welt and a bruise. \n\nI get it, work sucks, people are rude, it's hard, but common lady, don't draw blood for a living if your bad mood is gonna affect your work. You're literally hurting people. It's honestly fine at the end of the day, I won't die. I just really would not recommend getting your tests here.","5418898":"While in Drexel area, I decided to pay this place a visit, because I was hungry and wanted to avoid fast food which I often get. I ended up ordering for pickup on Grubhub, because they offered a 5 dollar discount on all orders. I had been to a Fuel location previously in center city, which was decent. \n\nI came in about 15 minutes after ordering on the app to pick up, and I sat down to eat in the restaurant. The ambiance was decent, and the area was fairly clean. \n\nI had ordered the 'South Philly' sandwich on rye, which ended up having some chicken, cheese, and saut\u00e9ed pepper. To be honest, I would say this was mediocre at best. The sandwich seemed to lack any sort of sauce, and the chicken was somewhat dry. It came with some  pile of leaves on the side, which seemed like a lame salad with literally just greens. \n\nI had also ordered baked 'Sweet Potato Fries.' These we're also somewhat disappointing, and they were pretty soggy. I understand that baked fries won't be as crispy as deep-fries ones, but from personal experience, I know tasty baked wedges are possible to make. I did, however, enjoy the spicy ketchup on the side. \n\nOverall, I probably wouldn't pay this place a visit again. The food wasn't awful, but it definitely isn't worth the prices, and I can definitely make this stuff at home with much better quality. I like the idea of fast, casual healthy food. But I've definitely seen other restaurants do it MUCH better before.","5424998":"They decided to close without notifying any customers just locked up and left in the morning on a weekday. Didnt leave a note or anything. Lazy *****. Not to mention they close at 2 every day anyway which is bullshit in and of itself","5425238":"The staff today in the back were miserable. The woman up front in reception was nice. Two different women were completing my order for me in the back and both just kinda grunted orders. They didn't say hi or how are you, didn't communicate what they were going to do next, weren't smiling. They only had enough breath to say:  \"I said do this. Go here. I said open your hand.\" They just seemed very impatient and grumpy. It was not pleasant to be around either of them.\n\nThis is somewhat on par from previous experiences, but definitely more so this time around.","5428248":"Quality is inconsistent. I've ordered before and the food was good, but for some reason, my order today (a bulgogi rice bowl) was seriously lacking: only half the container was full and there was ONE, yes ONE, piece of kimchi. I ordered this from postmates so I'm wondering if they skimped knowing the customer wasn't in front of them...? Just a guess!","5430912":"If I didn't have COVID going in I got waiting in the cramped sweltering lobby while waiting 45 minutes for them to corale 8 people outside and do our tests all at once - still haven't gotten my results hours later but know this place is so worthless I should just try again somewhere else","5432203":"DO NOT GO OR MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. \n\nI wish I read reviews prior to choosing this urgent care. Terrible experience. Waited over an hour for a scheduled appointment and didn't get a phone call or email with test results for over 48 hours (still waiting). \n\nI called 8x and no answer and emailed 3x. When I called I couldn't even leave a voicemail. \n\nAs an urgent care your patients health should be priority and this treatment is unacceptable. I did not feel safe, protected and the standards of their practice definitely didn't follow CDC guidelines. They were unprofessional and seemed to be under qualified, too. \n\nI hope this urgent care can be reevaluated in the near future to see if it meets basic guidelines for providing medical attention and advice.","5433972":"Understaffed. If you try to call you never get through to a person, and there is no one present at the counter. Check-in is done via a kiosk computer, so if you have to actually talk to someone it's physically not  possible. Convenient location with parking but expect to wait up to an hour even with an appointment.","5435641":"This restaurant was a complete letdown. It did not feel very clean inside, the wait was long for the short line, and the workers were not very friendly. And, of course, the food was no good. My smoothie was extremely watery and lacked flavor. The bowl I ordered had maybe 4 tiny pieces of chicken and a ridiculous amount of poorly-cooked rice. It tasted so horrible to the point where I could barely eat it. Save your money and go elsewhere.","5438463":"Advanced diagnosted is a great place to go to for Mri. Its opened.& u can watch tv at the same time. The staff is very friendly. Make u feel like right at home.They are great. Kudos. I would not go any place else for MRI","5440005":"In reading the other reviews, I suppose one's experience is very much determined by the sales associate present. I've been to other GNC locations where the staff was pushy etc. Not the case on my particular visit here. Guy was friendly, looked up my loyalty account, rang up my order. No questions, no pushing. Very easy going and professional.","5442055":"Not kid-friendly at all. The phlebotomist had a very hard time getting into my son's vein & couldn't draw the blood properly. The blood just wouldn't come out and he was getting visibly upset. She kept shifting the needle within the vein, causing him pain. And when he started crying, she just rolled her eyes and bluntly said \"sit still\". We'll never come here again. The Plymouth Meeting location is so much better when it comes to their patient approach. Their phlebotomist spoke to and treated my child nicely, which made a world of difference.","5445683":"Does anyone work at this store? Just went and they had the door locked with a \"be back in 5 min\" sign up for 30 mins.","5453653":"Went for an Mri ordered by my dr. waited 15 days as I repeatedly called for results that were tols done in 48 hours. I was told 2 weeks later results sent to doctor, went to appointment and no results. Called 3 different locations and no answer, finally reached out to pennsauken n.j. office and had a nice young lady help me and took all info. STILL WAITING ON RESULTS TO BE SENT TO MY DOCTOR 17 DAYS LATER.  If your in pain go elsewhere.","5454046":"I come here to get my Guinea pig's oral compound medicine, I am very impressed with Jack and his pharmacy.  Jack is very knowledgeable about Snickers' medicine and other medicines.  Plus he flavors it a 'tutti fruity' that Snickers doesn't mind the taste of.  He gives us a very reasonable price and dispenses the medicine into an easy to dispense, very hygienic bottle. \n\nI had gone to other pharmacies before who lacked customer service and were a pain to deal with. I'm thrilled with Jack and his pharmacy, I plan to be a regular customer and keep referring others!  Great pharmacy!","5455549":"I've been to numerous locations, but what sets this location apart is the help that I received. I don't recall the name of the lady who helped me, but she was very nice and extremely helpful. I was battling a cold and had a soar throat. She recommended this all natural spray that you use up to four times a day. I used it and felt better by the next morning. \n\nThe presentation of the shop is neat. It's also conveniently located a few steps away from LA Fitness. If you're going to work out and need a pre and\/or post workout drink or something along those lines, you can kill two birds in one stone.","5466905":"Update from my initial review. I submitted a formal complaint to the local BBB, and received a response from this urgent care. I felt like I was proofreading an English paper from a middle schooler, because it is filled with different misspelling (I have circled these for easy identification). It is extremely concerning that a company managing the health care of hundreds, maybe thousands of people cannot even send a proper letter. My concern regarding staff conduct was also not addressed.","5483581":"They are never in the store. This is the fourth time I've been out here where there's either a sign on the door or the lights are off. Poor management.","5487874":"I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! After making an online appointment there was still pretty long wait. The waiting room was filthy and it didn't seem that anyone here was clinically competent. There's a \"self swabbing\" procedure that takes place in the waiting room where all other patients see\/know why you're there. Not to mention can only occupy up to 2 ppl at a time. After my visit I was attempting to get in contact with the office and after several calls, still no answer. If there were an option for 0 stars I'd have selected it to represent this atrocity of an \"urgent care\".","5491793":"Went on a Friday during lunch and was in and out before my actual appointment at 12:45. The technician was very good. Would give 5 starts but i prefer to lay down as I often become faint while getting blood drawn and they only had one semi-recliner chair option available. Other than that, quick, clean and friendly.","5494666":"Terrible service. don't bother making an appointment because every time I have come for a test, I have waited over an hour each time. It's not even because there is a line or anything. Rather than testing people one by one at they come. They wait for a line to build and then in a large group test everyone. So disorganized and expect to wait over an hour last appointment.","5498091":"Went out of my way to get to this gnc. Arrived well after the store opened, there was a sign on the door that said \"Bank Run back in 10\" so I figured I'll run to the food store first then go.. 45 minutes later the sign is still there.. waste of my time","5499944":"I schedule me my appointment at this location on grant ave and was so disappointed. The young guy at front desk had no ma wash on during pandemic and seem a bit rude . I am hispanic and he address me by Mira very Unprofessional. He ask do you speak Spanish. He and his coworker were talking really loud. There was another patient that was ahead of me for an appointment she was getting little inpatient and decided ask front desk. The young lady proceeded on asking by screaming from front desk to the Mri tech in back .The patient looked at me and I looked at her we did not  have words. I ask lady how long have she been waiting she proceeded telling me 1 hour sitting here no one else in the back. Very Unprofessional.. First and last time I will visit this location.","5500248":"Google says opening hours go until 3:30 pm, but don't bother. They actually don't receive patients after 2:45pm.","5511112":"Food's good on the whole (I had the \"South Philly\" which was great\"), but it's a little on the expensive side (2 sandwiches 1 side dish came to $30), and service is very slow.  I definitely prefer their center city location. If a friend really wanted to eat here, I'd come back with them, but I likely wouldn't return on my own.","5512305":"staff is always very friendly and welcoming. The place is clean and staff washes their hands frequently. The a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls are very hit or miss","5516409":"Stopped in because I was in the area and in the mood for a coffee. \n\nDecided on a cold brew. I like cold brew.\n\nWhat I got was watered down dishwater. \n\nI gave up and went to Starbucks to redeem my tastebuds. I didn't even finish it. Big time letdown.","5520288":"I was sent to LabCorp for a Employment Drug Test because Concentra Urgent Care \"lost\" my drug screen! In reality I think the young lady did the screening improperly.\n\nThis LabCorp is located across the street from Jefferson Methodist Hospital in a \"strip mall\"-like setting. Very easy to walk by if you are not careful.\n\nWalked in and was greeted promptly by an employee who asked what I was there to have done and gave me instructions for using the check-in kiosk. Used the check-in kiosk, it scanned my Driver's License and entered me into the system. You can also pay for your visit at the kiosk. Once I checked in, I sat and waited to be called.\n\nDue to COVID-19, this LabCorp is allowing 5 people in the waiting area at a time (and there are exactly five chairs). The employees seemed nice and friendly. I didn't come in contact with anyone being nasty and rude.\n\nI was barely there may be fifteen minutes total! Quick and easy! I would definitely return to have bloodwork or other screenings.","5520962":"Well it's been a while since I've been able to get out so I'm just really glad about that. I was with a friend at Drexel and we came here for a smoothie. It was good. I wish I had known about the app, it would have been free!","5521322":"Just a quick positive review among the bad ones. Just one person working today and I waited an hour without appointment. I really do t think that's terrible. And I'm sure she is dealing with a few grumpies today but she was very nice, professional and precise with everything :)\n  So yeah - try to make reservation if you can or else make sure you have some time to spare if you don't!","5522278":"The best lab experience ever. Kat was incredible. Professional, happy, kind, efficient, funny and helpful. I was very upset to see her working with a broken AC unit and one fan. Her system also crashed a few times when entering info (with no complaints.) This company should work to fix these issues as this is an employee you do NOT want to lose. I hope her manager knows how special she is, especially in this industry. I get a lot of tests done and it makes such a difference to feel as though you are not a bother (this is common). Kat went above and beyond.","5523820":"The worst lab.  Have tried twice, same experience, frustrating. It's a shoebox size place, they don't regulate people in waiting room (should only be 2, they've had up to 6!) and workers laugh and waste time more than getting the work done.  Left after 45 minute wait first time, hit 20 minutes on second try before I went to Walnut location and was in & out in 10 minutes. Will save time and go to Walnut from now on!","5530899":"Honestly this place exceeded my expectations. \n\nI came here because I work in the area and Im always hunting for something good to eat. When I came here the first time I didn't have much of an appetite but was going to just settle for shake shack which is next door (not a huge fan of that place but I was tired). \n\nI got a protein booster smoothie. Banana, peanut butter, whey protein, and almond milk. It was only $5 and change which personally I don't think is too bad of a price. \n\nThey also have various smoothies, juices and sandwiches here. \n\nIve been back a couple more times and typically I just get a protein smoothie. But again, I work in the area so Ill be back to try other things. Its nice to have a place I can go to that isn't super expensive, is fast, and I don't feel guilty after eating it.","5534776":"I mainly come here because it is an open MRI but that would be the only reason to come here. I had a cervical MRI, my second at Advanced Diagnostics (first one was in 2012). The current MRI was never compared to the previous one for changes. When I inquired they said they would put in a request to do so but couldn't guarantee it because they don't keep records and images 7 years back. Really?? Most facilities keep them for at least ten years. The second reading was never done and I specifically asked them to let me know if it would be done. I never got a return call after the inquiry and the second reading wasn't done. I guess they felt they were not obligated to re do the reading. Poor service, I would not recommend this facility","5535301":"I'm not too keen on their food. The \"fill-er-up\" idea is probably your best deal since this place can get pricey very quickly. Though, being the healthiest spot on campus, I can't say I'm too mad. I mostly come here for the Protein Buster when I'm too lazy to bring my own protein shakes, and I'm super thrilled you can add creatine and other stuff to it if you want. There's no protein aftertaste which makes me recommend this double over. Obviously, healthy eating isn't cheap in general, so you could easily make all this stuff at home, but in a pinch when you're feeling lazy, I would at least give this place a shot.","5540963":"Just went into office to check in, they called my name rudely asked if I was coughing in waiting room, i said NO...they asked me again very rude...I said No...I'm not sick. They said we heard you couging... Really??? Um did you see that you had another patient in waiting room? It was not me...I said im here getting bloodwork because im not feeling well and I have medical issues and im sick...oh your sick...no stupid girls in office...rolling their eyes at me... I have medical issues...That's why people come here...and not to be rude to...","5542064":"The fat lady who was working there this morning 8\/13  was extremely rude and racist. Keep in mind it is 7:30 in the morning and she takes me back and I give her my paperwork and she starts mumbling and I literally cannot understand a single word she says other then room 4 and something about a urine test. I walk back to room 4 and barley set my bag down and she says\" did you do your urine test yet\" obviously not because I have no idea where the bathroom is or where to place it after and I LITERALLY just sat my bag down. Then while trying to look for the bathroom she says I gave that girl specific instructions if she does not want to follow them that's on her\" after that I made the decision that I do not want some nasty fat racist miserable woman stabbing me with a needle if she is already treating me like garbage for absolutely nothing. She needs an attitude check. I imagine the LabCorps only get worse the further into the city you go. So it looks like I will be going to jersey to get my blood drawn. Hopefully she gets fired soon.","5551769":"I usually really like working with this pharmacy and they've been very prompt about getting me my meds, but the last couples times I've ordered my meds they've messed them up.  Keep forgetting to send out my one med and then it comes way later.  And seem to keep getting my two meds confused, not sure why.  I will say they were quick and courteous in fixing the issues, but not sure why suddenly I'm having problems every time.  Not giving up on them, but slightly annoyed.","5559345":"This is my final update: after much time spent speaking with the insurance companies and it being nearly impossible to remain in touch with this business, the erroneous charge of $70 has been refunded to me due to their error. It is frightening that in a health crisis, these discrepancies are not fixed unless a great deal of advocacy is involved. This is unacceptable","5560925":"It was my first time eating at this location. The staff are very welcoming and friendly. The place itself isn't big, but it has couple of table to seat and dine in. It's a self service. The place itself it's clean. Food came out in to go plastic boxes. But it was delicious! I got a veggie burger and my friend got shrimp salad. Good food, good time.","5566092":"They must be understaffed here. It took forever to get my food and they didn't seem to know what they were doing. While I was buying my food the two staffers were just chilling and then suddenly started working 5-10 mins after I ordered. I get their understaffed but it just took forever.","5573996":"Walked in, No greeting.  I was asked my name and date of birth.  I was told that there was no script.  Uh...when I scheduled, I was told that my doctor had in-deed faxed the script the day prior.  Now, she moved some papers around; there it is.  The entire check in process was me standing at the window answering questions to the top of her head.  No face\/eye contact.  ( I was only person in waiting room).  The only pleasant person was the tech.  Was greeted with a smile and name, very nice giving me procedural directions.  At the end the tech walked me out and handed me my disc, with a cordial goodbye.  Can you tell that I was very unpleased with the front desk staff.  Very poor first impression.   Should I need another, I will not return to this site.  I would rather travel elsewhere.","5584903":"I can't say enough about Jack Korbutov and The Art of Medicine! Jack is a wealth of knowledge and patience! He is extremely knowledgable about what meds to take and why, what meds not to take, and what specific brands are better than others and why....and he Honestly, youHois so patient explaining all these details with you. Jack has advised me several times this year, and the most recent, was to provide the necessary meds to assist my daughter (who is a nurse on a Covid floor) with the increasing stress and health concerns working with these sick patients. \nIf you are in need of a prescription for you, a loved one or even your pet, please consider The Art of Medicine. Jack offers a limitless selection of customized medication for various disease states - and provides amazing patient care.\nHonestly, you will trust him after your first conversation with him. Give him a call. You won't be sorry.","5597548":"I went in with a sprained muscle and they were able to help me out so quickly! Much better than heading to the ER. Wonderful facility, great staff!","5638137":"Walked in, quick and thorough service. Left completely satisfied. Very convenient, affordable, and efficient.","5641447":"No waiting time. Friendly, mindful and knowledgeable staff. To top it off, copay is so much cheaper than an ER. \nI highly recommend it!!","5641789":"Prioritized a Fox News interview over patients while understaffed. I've been waiting 2 hours and still haven't been seen, when only a couple people were ahead of me when I arrived. This place is completely unprofessional and values publicity over their patients. Avoid at all costs and try your luck with literally any other urgent care facility in the city.","5648902":"Don't go there for anything overly complicated - they are not equipped for it nor do they have the expertise on it.","5662602":"My 85 year old dad and I were visiting and he had a skin rash that was really bad. Had been treated for it in Fl twice without any improvement. The hotel concierge where we stayed recommended the place. The all female staff Dr. And nurse practitioner treated him with great bedside manners and cured his rash with the right Meds. Thanks to them we were able to enjoy the rest of our vacation. The place is clean and we were out of there in no time. Thanks!","5685278":"I had a wonderful experience here, despite being sick! I walked in around 8pm after admitting that my symptoms couldn't be ignored anymore. There was just a 5 minute wait and the waiting room was nice- complete w\/ a TV, magazines, a water jug, and coffee. I was pleasantly surprised that an urgent care center in the city would be so clean and efficient- especially given the late hour. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful. The nurse & doctor were clear in their suggestions, personable, and knowledgeable. It was only $10 to visit with my insurance and definitely worth it for the peace of mind, prescription, and incredible convenience!","5685888":"I went here the other weekend when I needed to see a doc but didn't need to go to the ED. I was in and out in under 45 minutes which included all the new patient paperwork.  They also have a mini pharmacy which I was able to get my prescription from which saved me a trip to CVS. It's nothing fancy but super convenient if you are in a pinch.","5702775":"myDoc Urgent Care was perfect for when I was sick a few weeks back. I knew exactly what was wrong (sinus infection), but just wanted to get checked out and get a prescription. The nurse I had was a little off (could not remember any of the answers to the questions she asked me, had a lot of difficulty with the computer... she just made me feel a little awkward and uncomfortable). The thing that really got me, though, was that the nurse never asked me if I had any allergies and being as sick as I was I never thought twice about it. Luckily the nurse practitioner that wrote my prescription said something because I am severely allergic to certain medications and I would have found myself right back at myDoc without her saying something. Other than a bad experience with the nurse, I was extremely satisfied with myDoc and am happy they are in the neighborhood.","5708134":"I Googled this location when I looked to see a Doctor as I have been harboring a cold for too long! Called and told I could come in immediately. Great service. No wait. Got chest X-ray, vitals done, saw Matt- an awesome Medical Provider. Got a diagnosis AND prescription filled on the spot- and was out in no time. Extremely reasonable. There is nothing like this in Center City Philadelphia. For the basics- MyDoc Urgent Care was terrific. Highly recommend!!!","5713076":"This was the first time I've ever been to an urgent care, and it was actually very pleasant. The staff are friendly, professional, and very efficient. Obviously, any urgent care is limited in what they can do for you, but the staff is upfront about it so they don't waste your time. Would definitely recommend this place.","5716913":"I never understood why PCP's weren't open on the weekends, especially since that's when I normally come down with something. Fortunately, myDoc understands that not everything can wait until Monday.\n\nI was pleased with my experience and was surprised at how lovely the place was. There's a TV in the waiting room and a coffee table of up-to-date magazines. This alone gave me high hopes for the place.\n\nI was seen within minutes of arrival for my vitals and I probably only waited about two minutes for the doctor to see me. They carry some prescriptions in house, but they can also send them to your pharmacy if you think your insurance may cover the medication. That's the route I went and by the time I walked 10 minutes to my pharmacy, my script was ready to go!\n\nBonus: The staff actually cares about you. I called myDoc a few hours after taking my medicine because I had a nasty sore throat and felt super flushed. He spoke with me on the phone and encouraged me to come back in if I wanted him to look at it. This put me at ease and gave me peace-of-mind since I'm a natural-born worrier. \n\nThey accept some insurance and if you check-in on Yelp! you get 20% off your first visit! Definitely recommend!","5717786":"The best urgent care I've been to so far (although thankfully, my experience is somewhat limited). The employees and doctors were all very friendly and courteous, and the place had a positive vibe and some nice touches like complimentary snacks and coffee\/tea. My visit was brief and efficient - overall as pleasant of an experience as can be!","5730040":"Fantastic Service! The wait time was super short. No need to go to the ER and wait forever anymore!!!","5734748":"Super convenient. I walked in and was attended to quickly.\nFast, clean, friendly, competent service.","5782415":"Came in with Strep Throat. Given treatment for Strep Throat. Service was fast and friendly.","5812524":"This clinic is just what Center City needs.  I went around 9:00 this morning (Friday) and was in and out in under an hour - including new patient paperwork.  CRNP was knowledgeable, friendly and thorough.  It seems a bit pricey but appears to accept most insurance plans.  I would highly recommend for any non-ER and \"my PCP can't see me today\" kind of visit.","5852447":"Dr. Walkenstein is my absolute favorite Doc ever!! She was quick and informative as usual. Karen did such a great job drawing my labs (i didn't even flinch!!) i'll recommend this place to people that i know!","5855218":"This is a great place to go if you need basic medical help. I came in because I was having flu-like symptoms. It only took an hour to complete my paperwork, get assessed by the NP, and have a few swabs done. The NP who saw me was very nice, attentive to my concerns, and knowledgeable; he even personally called in my prescription. The office accepted my insurance and apparently accepts most forms of insurance (except Medicaid).\n\nAlso, you can get 20% off your first visit if you check in with yelp.","5866124":"Very good experience at this urgent care.  Everyone was very professional and kind and I was out of there in no time!","5866436":"Good experience. In and out in under an hour. Receptionists were nice, and medical personnel were great. Nice waiting area with drinks and energy bars.","5870566":"The staff here is absolutely wonderful. From the receptionist, who told me how many patients were ahead of me to the NP who made it seem like I was the only patient there even when they were so busy. Definitely the only place I will go for non emergency treatment.","5875745":"Of course I hurt my back the first day of vacation! The staff was friendly and accommodating from the check in desk to the NP who saw me. They offered me water & tea as soon as I walked in! My prescriptions were sent to the closest pharmacy, and they even phoned me a few days later to check that I was feeling better!  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because there were steps to get into the Urgent Care and no handicap access that I could see.","5883431":"Can't say enough good things about this location.  Don't let the renovation outside fool you.    I was on vacation in Philly from Boston and needed some medical help while away.The staff onsite, Matt and Zach, were fantastic and had me back out being a tourist within 40 minutes.  They were friendly, knowledgeable, and made the process of getting treated easy and quick.  Following my visit, they followed up several days later and made sure everything was working fine.  It didn't feel like an experience at the Doctor's at all.  Very grateful for their help.","5912793":"This facility is extremely clean and efficient. My only complaint is that It is not in network and a month after my visit I received a pricey bill in the mail. It's my fault for not inquiring about being in the Aetna Network, however due to this fact I will not be going back to this office. The price I now have to pay is absolutely not worth the visit I had.","5918461":"Wonderful service!  The nurse practitioner on duty knew exactly what the problem was with my daughter.  Highly recommend this urgent care.","5928837":"Brought a friend here for a sprained knee. The place was friendly and clean, the staff were knowledgable and professional. Everyone was very nice and Zach the receptionist was wonderful.","5930655":"Very professional, quick, thorough, friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend. Thank you Dr. Noi, Tasha and Kayla..","5960489":"I went to this location a handful of times earlier this year and had fantastic experiences--the phlebotomist was friendly, helpful, professional, and did a great job. Enough that I specifically chose to return to this location.  HOWEVER when I went back in December there was a different phlebotomist working. It seemed like maybe she was talking to herself while pulling up my information but then when\nshe was actually taking my blood it became clear that she was ON THE PHONE on a personal call--I guess she had a Bluetooth earpiece on under her head covering. I work retail, I know that jobs can get boring when you're there all day but being on the phone while providing healthcare, especially WHILE YOU ARE PUTTING A NEEDLE INTO SOMEONE is entirely unacceptable.","5969511":"My doctor's office hadn't electronically transmitted the request for bloodwork like they said they had, and the phlebotomist was really helpful and patient in helping me sort that out. \nThe waiting room was pleasant and I didn't wait long, either.","5980631":"The waiting room is very clean and bright.  You check-in by holding your I.D. up to this iPad (super futuristic).\n\nThere seems to only be one person who works here, but she's super efficient and nice.\n\nThis is not an exaggeration:  I went in at 9:28 and was out by 9:38.\n\nNormally I am afraid of getting my blood taken, but this time it was pretty easy.  She found the vein right away and only pricked me once.  (I've had experiences other places where they go multiple tries in both arms.)  \n\nIt's now a few hours later and I don't have any soreness in the area.","6031504":"Dr. Amy was extremely nice and caring. I was nervous about going to an urgent care but it was fine and I felt totally comfortable there. The paper work was easy, they took my insurance and I spent about less than an hour there.","6039145":"First time ever at an urgent care and I lovedddd that I found this place via google search. It's so close to where I work.\n\nPlace is tucked downstairs next to a bunch of construction. It's a pretty tidy little lobby. I was a first-time visitor, seen in triage, treated for a skin abscess, prescribed medicine, and left all within the hour. But the main reason for my 5 stars was Jenny, CRNP and Dr. Tang; both are so sweet, respectful, honest and knowledgeable. \n\nDefinitely recommend giving this place a try.","6039758":"I had a great experience at myDoc urgent care. The front desk staff was very friendly and efficient, they took my insurance and had me back with the nurse immediately. The nurse was compassionate and very thorough charting my complaint\/symptoms (I had a cold and an annoying cough that keeps me up at night). The nurse practitioner saw me within 10 minutes, she was very friendly and helpful. Overall it was a quick, friendly and helpful experience which is what I look for when I am not feeling my best! Thanks 1420 Locust myDoc!","6044317":"I was blown away by this place. I had just come from the CVS minute clinic right around the corner that was a three hour wait.  I saw the sign for it and thought why the hell not? I had just recently had a really bad experience at a Doctor's Express in South Philly so I was skeptical.  I have a primary care doctor but she couldn't see me until next week.  I went in and it was so clean and they have really nice couches and a huge flat screen TV (with the olympics on). They also have water, coffee, snacks, etc.  I just felt immediately welcomed.  The front desk staff was very friendly and respectful of the fact that I was very sick. I saw the doctor I would say within 15 minutes.  Her name is Jenny Diehl and she was so sweet and helpful.  Not the typical \"let's get you in and out of here so I can get to the next patient\".  She really wanted to make sure that she figured out what was wrong with me because I had been on antibiotics for 10 days and was still very sick.  She ended up testing me for mono and I tested positive which answered the question as to why I wasn't responding to antibiotics. She made sure she took the time to explain to me everything I needed to do in order to get better, answered all my questions, and I didn't feel rushed at all. \n\nI've been to quite a few Urgent Cares before and this is by far the most positive experience I've ever had.  I do have a primary care doctor but if for whatever reason I can't get an appointment soon enough, I will ABSOLUTELY be coming back.  Thank you so much to the staff, I appreciate how great all of you were so much!","6045950":"In and out quick - kind and professional - a comfort for this traveller with a cut scalp","6056948":"Super fast! Came in at 11:30 out by 12. \nStaff was super friendly and dr was great. Was also able to get my prescription there instead of going to the pharmacy","6059857":"I got exactly what I needed within a total of maybe 30 minutes, whereas I was mistreated and mislead for 3 times that or more by the assholes at Vybe. The staff at MyDoc is knowledgeable, adept and actually capable of decent interactions with patients. Quite literally a breath of fresh air through this (soon-to-be-erstwhile, thanks to Dr. Amy!) bacteria-riddled throat.","6072722":"I was very impressed with the care I received here.  I have a complicated medical history but developed a very common side effect of my treatment. The highly trained resident at the world class university hospital couldn't\/wouldn't come off of her academic high horse to offer me any relief so I decided to try this urgent care.  Not only did they resolve my problem, they did so with kindness and compassion.","6073184":"This place, where do I even begin..Let's say this was probably my worst experience at a clinical office EVER and they deserve nothing more than a 1 star without a doubt. Surely I will never be back, I honestly would rather be in the ER than come back to this place again.\n\nSo the story is one Saturday I had a slight cough and just wanted to quickly see a doctor to get a prescription and just to find a doctor on the weekend since I recently moved to town and it seemed more PCPs were off on Saturday. Because I was new, I went there and the lady at the counter looked into my insurance to try and explain to me how things worked. She told me confidently there was only a $30 copay that I would need to pay for this office checkup, which I even confirmed several times with her. Now being someone who's always been in a doctor's office and not urgent care, I wasn't sure what to expect and trusted the staff at the front desk would tell you up front what you would pay or even some estimates of costs consider I wrote on the paper \"a slight cough, minor soar throat\" so I assume it wouldn't be that severe compared to a broken foot or xrays. Well guess what, I got charged $546.33, with $439 for \"office evaluation and management services\". Pretty insane oh and I haven't even gotten to the \"services\" yet.\n\nWithout the doctor even checking on me or me even knowing who the doctor was, they immediately just put me in a room to a strep test($68 services). How can you start doing random tests and charging patients when the doctor hasn't even seen you? Ok, that's not even the worst part. They next put me in a room, close the door, and tell me that the \"doctor will be with you shortly\". I waited over an hour(no exaggeration) without a single nurse, doctor, or worker coming to check on me. Because the walls are so thin in the office you could pretty much hear the staff just chatting it up outside. I had gotten so fed up at that point that literally left the room to go to the front desk by the waiting room and in front of all the other patients yelled at them for not having a single person come and check on me in over an hour. Forget just me, I think there was another person in the other room that had a real injury and was probably just waiting there forever. I understand there were other patients before, but what type of doctor's office leaves their patients closed in a room for such long periods of time without having someone even check on them. I've been in super crowded pediatric offices, dentist offices, podiatrist, and bad hospitals and have never had such dysfunctional services before.\n\nI'm not going to complain too much about the doctor because she was a nice person but she was very young and didn't have as much experience as your typical PCP doctor. They also really needed a PA or a nurse to have assisted with taking care of their patients but it seems there just wasn't very much services being offered. \n\nOk so I leave and weeks later I get the bill from them. I contacted myDoc when I got the bill for $600! and they told me the insurance didn't pay for it all, so I would need to pay the rest(the $200 AFTER \"discounts\"). I asked why it was so expensive when they told me in the beginning it was only $30 and the lady said on the phone, \"yes a lot of people ask me the same question..\" Well DUH, if everyone's complaining to you about the payment then you guys are obviously wrong. I questioned, if it cost without insurance $125 why does it cost me $200 and a $600 charge to my insurance? The lady started condescendingly telling me \"It's because we have office staff like me and I have an MBA degree. I have to look at the issue for 30 minutes, and talk to you for 30 minutes you know how much time I already spent?\". Seriously? Like I really care what degree you have and how much time you spent figuring out why you charged me $600 when you were chatting about the weather while I was sick in your office. \n\nThey honestly don't care about you. I would not give them my money again and I strongly suggest you find a REAL doctor's office that actually cares about its patients and is not focused on trying to take you or your insurance company's money.","6073427":"Friendly, clean and quick.\nEveryone here was nice, personable and kind. \nWent in for a finger injury... took less than 40 minutes with exam and x-rays and was given the x-ray results on a cd to take with me.","6093210":"I really want to give one star. They are supposed to be helping my wife. She had back surgery and she has a problem with walking. She's supposed to be getting physical therapy for the next few months. These people schedule appointments and show up late or extremely early. Very unprofessional . I don't understand how they are still in business? I gave the two stars because a couple of the employees are nice.","6095385":"They say they take just about any insurance, and checked my insurance card at check-in and gave me no reason to believe there would be any problem, but then my insurer denied the claim for being out-of-network.\n\nDespite my insurance company being very clear about the reason for denying the claim, the billing person tried to claim that the reason I was being billed is that I hadn't met a deductible. The thing is, my plan doesn't have a deductible. So she's either very bad at her job, or a liar. Ordinarily I try not to attribute to bad faith what can just as easily be explained by incompetence, but in this case, both I and my insurance company explained very clearly that a deductible was not the issue.\n\nAny reasonable business would be embarrassed by having misrepresented the insurance they take (assuming it was unintentional) and would eat the cost. But not myDoc's billing department: they sold it to debt collectors despite the charge being under dispute.\n\nThe care I received from the doctor was just fine, but I would have found another place to go if I had known they didn't take my insurance. I would additionally note that putting patients in a position where they can't be sure--despite promises on the web site to take any insurance--whether they'll get a surprise bill later cannot possibly be good for business in the long run.","6096106":"Everyone from the Nurse care manager. PT, OT, and the hospice team and office people at Bayada are absolutely incredible!! They make dealing with the stresses of caring for a loved one so much easier to handle. I highly recommend their company and would give 10 stars if I could. Thank you to everyone that has helped our grandmom transition into her next stage of life.\n\nForever grateful\nJill\nReading PA","6097192":"RUDE RUDE RUDE!!! Both staff were on their phone during the entire visit in private phone calls. the one woman was speaking on her cellphone threatening to \"come stomp on her face\" to the person on the other end. extremely rude and unprofessional","6098127":"myDoc's billing practices are basically a scam. They required $99 Covid test deposits even though they were in my insurance network (First Health). Then they billed the wrong insurance, and when it was rejected, they didn't bother to follow up with me. I had to hound JingJing Cai to get them to properly file the claim. My insurance immediately paid the negotiated rate of $93 that myDoc agreed to in its contract. \n\nmyDoc did not refund any of the deposit for almost 3 months after receiving the insurance check - and JingJing is refusing to refund the difference between the $93 negotiated rate and the $99 deposit, which is a breach of their contract with First Health. My insurance company's grievance department is going to follow up to make them refund the deposits in full. \n\nThese tests were in October and November 2020, it's June 2021, and I'm still fighting with myDoc. What a nightmare.","6099501":"The waiting room is nice but it has to be considering that's where you spend most of your time. \n\nI came in as a walk-in because I wasn't feeling well and, with only one other person in the waiting room, I thought it wouldn't take that long... I have been waiting now for 47 minutes, paid $75, and still haven't been called into a patients room. \n\nGood thing they have comfortable couches- maybe I'll just take a nap.","6100230":"I wish I could give 'negative' stars. The entire staff, from receptionist to medical assistant to 'provider' (a physician's assistant), were rude, inexperienced, and unhelpful. I have a simple ear infection and they refused to do anything but try to squirt water into my already infected ear. No thank you. I was completely unimpressed and they didn't seem to have any idea as to what they were doing. Icy reception from the minute I walked in. The way they handled themselves and their tools made me extremely weary of them doing anything but very basic exams like look into my ears, check my pulse\/blood pressure etc. I wouldn't trust them to do anything beyond that and they wanted to irrigate my ear using some kind of water tool. The medical assistant said 'shit' at one point during our clinical encounter. I practically walked out. I can't believe how rude they were and I've had many surgeries and doctors during my lifetime. I would steer clear of this place. I can't wait to see what kind of bill that I get in the mail for their ineptitude and carelessness.","6109707":"I went to this Urgent Care Tonight and had a very positive experience. It's extremely clean and all of the staff are very professional, courteous, and polite.","6112946":"This place is either a scam or just completely unorganized. I went in for a rapid Covid test and thought I would have the results in an hour. I had to go back to work, and the call came while I was in an important meeting. I called back using the number they gave me, as well as every other number I can find associated with mydoc in Philadelphia, and could not get anyone to pick up. You can't even leave a voicemail because it says the mailbox is full. I called fourteen times, and now they're closed so there's no chance. I needed the results for an event tomorrow and now I will not have them and I wasted $75. How do they not have a voicemail, or an email notification, or an online portal...or even the decency to call you twice if that's the only way you can get your results??","6112984":"They never fill in shifts when needed. If your nurse is on vacation or calls out your loved one is left without care. The worst office in center city where no one communicates and they don't care about the patients needs.","6113880":"Absolutely terrible company. Several years back my mother had a fall and used Bayada. The occupational therapist and aide were good but the physical therapist was incompetent. Fast forward to recently, my mother had another fall. I had her at in the Nazareth ER (Mercy) and the next day Mercy Health had a nurse out. My mother was in such pain that at the nurse suggested I take her to a different ER. I took her to Jeanes (Temple). They treated and discharged her with a recommendation for home health. They contract with Bayada. Since my Mom's primary doctor is with the Temple system she thought it made more sense to use their contracted provider, Bayada. For 11 straight days I called Bayada to get the ball moving. Nothing happened. It was one excuse after another - we didn't receive the script from the doctor, the script was not detailed enough, etc. They made me do all the work. After 11 days and getting absolutely nowhere, I called Mercy. I had a call back within a half hour letting me know everything would be taken care of. Within 2 hours I had a call telling me a nurse was assigned. Within 15 minutes from that call I received a call from the nurse to introduce herself. She was out the next day. They also began sending a physical therapist, an occupational therapist and an aide. Mercy managed to accomplish within a couple of hours what Bayada could not do in eleven days. The quality of care was also much superior that we experienced with Bayada several years ago. The bottom line is that I would never again even consider using Bayada Nursing.","6121399":"3700 Market Street location is the gold standard for customer service. \"ASHLEY\" is the sole personnel in the office. The office is very clean and maintained... protocols are definitely in place. Ashley checks in, take specimens, process specimens and runs the entire operation herself. She is the epitome of \"World Class Service\". She is extremely pleasant, more then efficient and her professionalism is 2nd to none. This location is highly recommended. Get an appointment first!!! It makes your visit even that much more rewarding. Thank you Ashley from Mr. Abdullah.","6123385":"I went there in November with stomach issues. They realized that I needed to go to an emergency room and sent me there. However, without providing much care, they still charged me $50 for my \"visit\" even though they didn't do anything for me. A couple years ago when I went to another urgent care facility, when they realized they were not going to be able to help me, they did not charge me for the 5-10 minute visit.","6129585":"BAYADA HHA just abandoned my son. He requires 24 hour care. Replacement HHA hasn't shown up. I'm out of town watching on camera. I did speak with Bayada's scheduler Kelly Claypoole. She didn't appear bothered by the fact he would be alone. My son has epilepsy\/physical and mental disabilities and the mental capacity of an 8 to 10 year old. I sent an email to the Manager Shane McNamara. No response. BAYADA has been going down hill for about 2 years now. We've been with BAYADA since 2009. Lately the problems have been increasingly irresponsible. I was also told they have no one for the overnight nor the weekend late shift. Needless to say I have to move on. Couple years ago I was Bayada's biggest cheerleader. Now they're trash!!! This is the Philadelphia PA office downtown Philadelphia!!! I see something says CA!! Nope, Philly","6137287":"I came here in September just to be told I have a cold even though I had been practically dying for a week. They charged me multiple times, although not helping me at all, upwards to $200 by the end of it. I then went to my family doctor outside of the city and was told I had the flu. Go anywhere else for your health care.","6141889":"In reference to my last review, I'm providing an update. I received a call from the director, a Ms. Webster who shared her concerns about my issues with my coordination of care provider.She assured me she would handle the matter and apologized for the negative experience I had to endure. It's sad that you have to write a review that shows a company in a bad light to prompt attention to get an Issue corrected. \nThank you MS. Webster.","6143313":"Honestly I don't understand why the other review are criticizing this place so much? Got a rapid test and it was $25 (in comparison to $75 at vybe urgent care). The whole processes took about 10 minutes when I was there. Results came back within 30 minutes. I'm definitely going back if I need to get covid tested again.","6146374":"Former employee. This is by far the worst health care company I've ever experienced. 25+ years and I've worked for 3 companies. Bayada office staff are condescending to employees and clients. They tell the employees too many unnecessary personal  details about clients and their families. It's not important to your job but more resembles gossip. I got plenty of gossip but sometimes not enough real info about a clients needs. They sent an older aid with back trouble after mento a client that requires the use of a hoyer. She couldn't do it so I had to stay and help (off the clock) They knew her limits and his needs but sent her anyway. I've heard office staff talk to clients with a very condescending attitude. Rutland office staff need some real training.","6148464":"Just got a very big bill in the mail for this place.  They used to have a list of prices up but I can't find anything online anymore to cross-check from what I understood the prices were.  Beware and confirm prices before you go.","6151325":"Like previous reviewers, we've had terrible experiences with Bayada.  My mother has been using Bayada for a few years now, so this isn't just a one time negative experience.  She initially contracted with Bayada for home health care after several falls and surgeries for those falls.  She had a few home health aides that were absolutely wonderful - kind, patient, helpful, everything you want in an aide.  She also had a few that were lazy, stole from her, showed up at odd hours and left to \"go to the store\" without giving her change back, would go through all of her things to look for something to steal, etc.  There were also some in between who were not at either extreme, but just lazy and didn't want to help with her basic needs like getting her shoes on and off after a Dr. appointment.\n\nMy mother is a loyal customer to any business she frequents and tries to hope for the best in any situation.  However, she was diagnosed with cancer recently and her care and coverage has been subpar at best, dangerous at worst.\n\nThe scheduler\/coordinator will often switch out aides and leave my mother with no aide and no indication that nobody is coming to help her until we call to find out.  Sometimes we will find out ahead of time from the aide that they are scheduled to be off the next day, the coordinator will not schedule coverage for my mother and go so far as to blame the aide who let everyone know ahead of time.  I've received calls from the coordinator after talking to my mother, where she is not aware that I already know what's going on.  She'll try to cover herself to pretend like she wants to know if the aide showed when my mother already spoke with her and myself to let us know that nobody was there to help her.\n\nThere were times in the past few months when my mother was extremely sick and ended up being hospitalized.  During those times she was still not covered in spite of her extreme illness and empty blame\/promises from the coordinator.  According to the coordinator, it is everyone else's fault that my mother wasn't covered.  \n\nAt this point, I'm pretty sick of the back and forth with the coordinator and my mother's health is not being taken into consideration.  I don't know if the care is better through other offices of Bayada or if all of the coordination of care is this unprofessional and dangerous for the clients.  I'm only writing this review after the most recent repeat of this situation where my mother is at home, sick, without coverage because it wasn't scheduled by the coordinator after the regular aide told everyone she wasn't available today.\n\nBayada should look into the work of their coordinators.  They're setting themselves up for lawsuits if a client is sick and not covered and something happens because the coordinator didn't schedule someone where they were needed.  After reading the other reviews, I don't know if they're dealing with the same office or if it's every office in Bayada that is poorly coordinated.\n\nGood luck to everyone.  Choose a different home care agency.","6153180":"My doctor ordered lab work for me. I am visiting from out of state and I called the lab to confirm that my orders where in so I can come by and get my blood work completed. The recording stats that I leaven a message and someone will return my call. Well, 3 calls and two weeks have gone by and still not a response. Nice work Labcorp.","6157994":"Rude, unprofessional, and a totally disinterested figure greeted me as I walked in. Blood work was a nightmare.. She is tossing and throwing the injections in the bin.. Inserts the needle in my skin so hard that the bleeding still hasn't stopped after an hour. Rude, rude rude.. \n\nFOR YOUR own sake, please avoid this location.","6159345":"I went in with pink eye which is usually a $60 in-and-out quick fix. Not here. I was charged $120 to be told within 5 seconds that there was nothing they could do. Next day I went to AFC Urgent Care South Philly and they actually treated me. Highly recommend them! It was also the normal $60 there that I was used to seeing.","6168340":"Mycrook Urgent Care. These people aren't healthcare professionals they are disorganized, inefficient and fraudulently bill their patients. When I arrived it was as if they had never seen a patient before. Go to vybe for real healthcare needs save yourself the pain and suffering on hold waiting to speak with one of their employees\/disputing with your bank.","6172820":"Prioritized a Fox News interview over patients while understaffed. I've been waiting 2 hours and still haven't been seen, when only a couple people were ahead of me when I arrived. This place is completely unprofessional and values publicity over their patients. Avoid at all costs and try your luck with literally any other urgent care facility in the cot\n\nUpdate: Came to find out days later after visiting a real doctor that they diagnosed me completely wrong. Gave me the wrong medications that actually may have made my sickness worse according to my real doctor. Would give -5 stars if I could.","6176241":"Truly the best LabCorp I've ever been to. Have been to a few around the area and understand why LabCorp gets a bad rap - they're usually horrible, but this location is an exception. It's small and clean, as well as very efficient with professional staff. Will continue to return and doubt I'll ever go to another location again, as long as this one is up and running!","6177848":"Would give less than a star due to the rudeness of the person in the front desk. Not sure if Doctors are not on service on a Saturday but the lady today (nurse practitioner I believe) was just rude and unhelpful!","6181063":"Went there when they first opened with a bad respiratory infection.  Waited almost 3 hours to see Not a doctor but a Nurse.  She would not prescribe me antibiotics because she said I was too old (I am 53 years old). I was given bad treatment and a huge bill.","6190490":"In the beginning the communication was off between the person scheduling and the staff members. Twice someone was scheduled to come and no one came. However, once everything was set. The services my mom received from Robyn (occupational therapist), Gladina (physical therapist) and Mechele (nurse) were outstanding. They were all attentive, informative and treated my mother in a very caring manner. I just wanted to say thank you!","6191215":"Was seen here after being told they accepted my insurance. 2 years later, received a bill at my mother's home in California.","6194150":"The actual urgent care service was fine, but billing is a nightmare. \n\nI went in May '21 for a Covid test and was told that I needed to put down a $85 deposit because I had a high deductible insurance plan (I did not).\n\nWhen my insurance covered the test and I had my EOB issued, it took two months of repeated calls and emails to get the deposit refunded.","6198801":"My mother just passed but was under the care of Bayada hospice of Toms River, NJ. There are some very special people that work there!! Moms aid Barbara was exceptional! She treated and cared for my Mother like she was her own. She showed and displayed true comfort and care. She's truly an angel!","6206330":"The receptionists are great but the doctor and nurses gave so many microaggressions. I'm afraid to go back.","6211212":"If you're a veteran and the VA tries to hook you up with this company, do whatever you can to reject them.\n\nThey receive $26+ per hour from the VA to provide caregivers, but only pay the aides $10-$11 per hour.  In my experience (over a year) 90% of my aides came out for a few days and left because they couldn't afford to make the 30-45 minute drive, and Bayada wouldn't increase their pay for travel.  They'd toss a few gas cards to a few, but not enough to make a difference.\n\nI elevated my concerns all the way to the corporate level and it never helped.  They finally dumped me.\n\nI'm now in the Veteran Self-Directed Care program and able to pay my aides a decent wage plus travel and have had the same one for six months.  I'd love to see Bayada lose every veteran to this program - - the amount of money they receive for the level of service they provide is obscene.","6212331":"I would like to know how does Bayada make their staff accountable for the service they provide? If a patient has a number of hours approved, is it not in their best interest to find a home attendant to cover those hours?  One should expect that if the home attendant is ill or on vacation, Bayada is ready to cover those slots and one doesn't have to be constantly calling to confirm there will be someone coming and  have to accept schedule changes just to get some help. Management needs to rate their staff and make them accountable for the service they provide.  They are not doing us a favor. They are getting paid so they need to know what \"Customer Service\" mean.  I am currently looking for other options","6214565":"Been to this place 2 times to try to get my pregnant wife her blood work. We both work busy schedules but we were able to get there a few minutes before they closed. Except when we got there (before closing) they said they were closed! We decided to come back today, but apparently they are all at lunch at the same time. Yes, they all take lunch from 12-1 and then they close at 2:30. What a joke of a place.","6216480":"Bayada care is the WORST!!  Stay away. Their home health aides don't show or they show up late. My 93 year old mother has had 2 no-shows in the last 3 days!  I don't know how they stay in business.","6217205":"Help was needed for 24 hour post surgery assistance.  This time was split between two nurses.  Everything was professional from the first evaluation to the quality of care.  Both nurses arrived in a very timely manner, and both were incredibly friendly, helpful, and qualified.","6220954":"This place is a scam. Received a notice that my visit from almost two years ago is not covered by my insurance when they confirmed that they accept my insurance","6226275":"Bayada is a fantastic care company. My aide, Lexi, is always really pleasant and friendly. She isn't that much older than me so we have a lot of things in common.  She is very understanding of my  special needs and is also just a great listener and nice to talk with in general. Beth, the RN manager is a really sweet person as well.  The only complaint I can really make is that the scheduling can be iffy but that's been a rarity. My care is on hold right now but I hope to start getting help from them again soon. I'd definitely recommend Bayada to anyone looking for a good home health agency. Cheers, Yelp!","6228679":"Went in to get stitches for a small laceration and 2 days later im in the ER with my whole leg infected. They were really not equipped to deal with issues like this. My wound was not washed or wrapped properly which led to the infection. Please go to and actual doctor or ER, they are much nicer, more professional, and actually care about you getting better, these people are greedy pigs who just want your money.","6229360":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE:\n1) THEY ASK YELP TO DELETE BAD REVIEWS\n2) YOU MAY GET A BIG BILL LATER IN THE MAIL, SINCE WHAT YOU PAY AT THE FRONT DESK DURING CHECK-IN IS JUST A PORTION (WHICH THEY DON'T SAY OF COURSE) AND THEY WON'T TELL YOU THE TOTAL COST AT CHECK IN\n3) THEY WILL TURN YOU INTO COLLECTIONS AGENCY, WHO WILL BE QUITE NASTY, IF YOU DON'T AGREE TO PAY THEIR BILL\n4) READ OTHER REVIEWS, YOU'LL SEE THAT MANY CUSTOMERS HAD A SIMILAR ISSUE WHEN THEY WERE SLAMED WITH UNEXPECTED CHARGES.\n\n\n**************\nUPDATE (as of 11\/22\/2016): I submitted a complaint to PA Attorney General and submitted an appeal to my insurance. As a result, UrgentCare cancelled my $90 charge.\n\nUPDATE (as of 11\/10\/2016): Collection agency started calling, they were so rude, told me several times \"you are confused\", told me several times \"you have copays\" (which I don't, it says on thy insurance card), interrupted me all the time and in the end simply hung up. \n\nUPDATE (as of 8\/26\/2016): I received a letter that if I don't pay $90 (on top of the $50 that I already paid), I will be turned into a Collections Agency.\n\n**************\nBeware of big unexpected charges that will come in the mail after your visit, $140 for a simple flu visit in my case.\n\nI paid $50 at the front desk, was quickly seen by the doctor and was in and out in under 1 hour. Then, to my big surprise, I received a bill for additional $90 ($140 total per visit that I owe; overall, my insurance was charged with $574.88 for the visit.)\n\nI called and wrote a letter explaining that I wasn't informed there will be more charges. Had I known it would cost me $140 per visit, I would have NEVER proceeded with seeing the doctor, and would have walked out immediately, because I could get the same service at my primary doctor for a fraction of this amount (~$20.)\n\nI was told by the CFO that's how much I must pay and the claim was processed correctly. I wrote another letter, and waiting for an outcome. \n\nThis is unfair to rip people off like that.","6234033":"I was in Philly the week the Pope was due to visit. I strained a muscle so found this place on Google. It wasn't listed elsewhere. I discovered that this place was just opening to the public when I made my appointment on the phone. \n\nWhat I didn't realise that the place was so new it was a bit disorganized. There was no one ahead of me but even after completing all the necessary forms there was no one to see me. The doctor was busy telling some contractor about some installation. I didn't like his tone and after a few more minutes I decided to leave.\n\nI never saw a doctor here. I did spend about 25mins here before leaving for the airport.\n\nOne thing to note. There are steps down to the basement level entrance. I didn't see a ramp so do check that with the front desk before coming.","6235741":"These people don't bother calling your insurance, if it doesn't show up in their system they simply charge you. Also they won't let you get a rapid if you request one and have told everyone that it's only accurate if you're symptomatic which is not true. No one was wearing N95s and they have you administer the test yourself which is not at all how the test is supposed to be done. Will not be going back.","6247716":"Bayada staff is the Abosolute worse they have no concern about their clients, I've been with Bayada since October of 2018, the care giver they sent me, she's Awesome, the coordinator who take care of scheduling are the absolute worse, if your assigned person calls out or will be late the coordinator does not call or send a replacement, it's a good thing I'm not bed ridden cause I would of been without help  until her next visit in two  and I wouldn't  of been given my medicine, fed or any of my needs met. After making a fuss ,I finally get a call if there's a schedule change but they still don't send a replacement. I was told to call and let them know when I have a doctors appt so my caregiver could escort me, well I did my part, they never called or scheduled the caregiver or sent anyone to escort me to my appointment,so thankfully my daughter called out of work and went with me. So I call the Bayada office in center city Phila to speak to the coordinator I get the usual response she's away from her desk but's she's working on my schedule for my appointment,  Really my appointment happened already. I tell the lady who answers the phone of my annoyance she tells me sorry I feel that way and she hangs up, so now I'll be sending their corporate office my complaint and if this medical neglect maybe I can sue them. Communication with the client is important and their getting paid to make sure I'm getting care I shouldn't be viewed as an annoyance when asking about my care and wanting to be informed of changes \nI'm sure some of they're offices run a lot more efficiently, but the one on Walnut Street is the absolute worse if there was a rank of triple negative zero it would definitely apply.\nC.J  M.S, Human Behavior B.S Psychology","6252869":"Nurse was really nice \nDoctor was a jerk--didn't know what my condition was which is fine (even though the nurse knew what it was immediately) and was very condescending about it. I went in for IV fluids which they advertise all over that they have IV therapy. After waiting 40 minutes and describing the symptoms that I had already included in my appointment request, I was denied the IV therapy that's not even covered by insurance. I went to urgent care because other IV clinics do not have the correct nausea med I need. Really disappointed, not looking forward to this ER trip.","6253060":"This place is awful. The people are so rude- no bedside manor and homophobic. It's 2019. Stop being bigots","6263614":"You never know if an employee is going to show up for work day by day. They say that they have 24hr on call services. \n\nYeah, leave a message! Good luck on the return call.","6267080":"This company promised to work with my father, who has Parkinson's, on a regular basis throughout the year.  Instead, they piled on services when he first moved to his Assisted Living facility and then within 2 months dismissed him without any explanation or follow-up with our family.  They just dropped him like a fly.  Guess his Medicare benefits were exhausted by them?  If they just needed another doctor referral in order to continue, his physician would have gladly provided that.  But again, there was no follow-up or communication to us by this organization.  So we are left to assume, and as an overwhelmed and underpaid caregiver and estate manager, I don't have the time to chase them.  They get a lot of money for the service they provide, they can and should do better.","6270577":"Came here at 5:45 on a Tuesday to find a hand-written sign on the door that said the urgent care facility was \"closed due to unforeseen circumstances\" like this is some shop or boutique that can just close whenever they feel like. Ok, I guess I'll just walk my sick self somewhere else.","6270578":"So below was the review I wrote when I went in for a visit. Though writing the review was motivated by a $10 off offer, I was honest and everything I said below remains true. With that said, BE CAREFUL going here. Quite possible it's a scam-type place. We have excellent insurance and it was a straightforward visit, but we ended up getting hit with a $400+ charge in the mail later (on top of what we paid at the visit...which is always all it is at other urgent cares). Not cool.\n\n-- Clean, conveniently located, and everyone who worked there was very nice and approachable. They even gave me a little gift bag with water and a pen on my way out! --\n\ntl;dr: Don't recommend.","6272413":"If you are looking for a quality urgent care facility in Center City, you won't find one here. I had an ear infection and my PCP gave me some ear drops to clear the infection. Within days of starting the ear drops, I developed a lot of swelling on my earlobe. I would have returned to my PCP, but since this happened on a Friday I had to opt for urgent care. I normally use Jefferson for urgent care, but after recently moving this location was closer so I decided to try it out.\n\nThe wait wasn't too long, maybe 30 minutes or so. The triage room where my vitals were taken barely counted as a room with only a curtain separating it from the waiting area as the nurse (loudly) confirmed my personal information. I was then taken to an exam room, where I was seen by the NP on duty. After telling her my issues, she shoved the probe into my ear (when I recoiled in pain she blamed it on my severe infection, which I knew was bogus since my ear felt much worse when I saw my PCP and she somehow managed to not lay me out during my exam). I was told that my ear was still very infected and that I had also developed cellulitis, for which she prescribed a very strong antibiotic. I was very skeptical of the diagnosis, but knowing the possible consequences of untreated cellulitis (i.e. sepsis) I decided to \"trust the expert.\"\n\nWell, two days into my antibiotic course my ear continued to improve, but I felt like absolute crap, and worst of all the swelling on my earlobe had now spread across my entire left cheek. So I went to Jefferson for a second opinion. After a short examination the doctor at Jeff said that there's no way I had cellulitis and that I likely had some contact dermatitis from the ear drops. He instructed that I discontinued the antibiotics and apply hydrocortisone valerate cream to the affected area. And lo and behold, within hours the swelling had gone down, and by the next morning when I followed up with my PCP the swelling was mostly gone. So in conclusion, in this world of multidrug resistant organisms, the NP at myDoc gave me a very strong antibiotic unnecessarily. My PCP told me to be wary of standalone urgent care centers, and now I definitely see why. If you have a choice, definitely go to Jefferson instead.","6274509":"What a scam. I just found out from my health care provider that they've been overcharging me. Who know how deep this rabbit hole goes in how else they're scamming the healthcare system that's already crippled. This is ONE of the major reasons why the healthcare system is in shambles; because of unethical doctors\/hospitals who charge exorbitant prices with little to no cap for a few minute service. I spent more time in the waiting room or waiting in the patient room than I did to have Dr. Tang give me a look-see and take my blood pressure and body temperature (an iWatch does that too, I came to a doctor for a reason). I received a notice from them that I owed $200 for my visit (3 months later) and that my insurance refused to pay when I pay $300\/month to my insurance. Called the insurance company only to find out that every claim has already been paid out so they didn't understand why my PCP was sending a paid out claim for me to pay. So instead of owing $200, I find out from my insurance company that they've overcharged me on my co-payments. Riddle me that PCP. \n\nUpdate- I spoke with Jing Jing (CFO) and she tried to educate me on the healthcare system and how it's unfair for doctors and how my first doctor visit is free and that the healthcare companies doesn't pay for it, as if I should feel grateful about receiving healthcare, PAID healthcare! Listen lady. Damn right it's unfair. It's unfair that I pay faithfully to a healthcare insurance company that I've used twice this year just to get a look-see and no damn follow-up. We don't need to educate patients on the healthcare system when the patient is trying to inform you of some gross error\/miscalculation on your organization's part.","6286784":"Bayada is a good company, but not great by any means. The one star is for the speech therapists and physical therapists. The speech therapist that came to my home gave me a few handouts and asked me questions after I read them. There was really no interaction with her other than her asking me to read what I saw and repeat it. She seemed thrilled that I was able to complete the excercies and not have to come back for another appointment. The physical therapist wanted to make sure that I was able to pick up things and walk around. I was using a walker at the time. Her way of making sure I could pick up things was to throw pencils on the floor in front of me and say \"pick them up\". I understand this might be a good exercise to do but the attidutde that was used was nonchalenat and made me feel like a dog doing tricks. Compassion and empathy training is something that Bayada might look into providing for its employees.","6293847":"Good shop for discounted vitamins Their store brands are inexpensive and effective. I've found their Saw Palmetto- Pygeum formula works best for me out of all the ones I've tried. Often they have sales on V.S. brand, such as 10% off, bygo 50% off, etc.They discount some name brands as well. Not as cheap as Vitacost however. If you are a member and spend a lot of bucks here you will get a rebate (not much) at end of year.\n\nI've found the employees to be very helpful in locating products. Most are friendly too. The dark- haired woman who I think is a manager is extremely gorgeous, which reminds me that I should shop here more often.","6362277":"Horrible customer service. Actually, NO customer service at all. Knew exactly what I wanted. Even brought pictures from THEIR website to make the purchase as easy as possible.","6384282":"I will not go back to this office. The entire support staff here is incredibly unprofessional, condescending, rude, judgmental and vulgar.  The practice manager appears to embrace\/create this culture. I have been repeatedly denied requests to speak to the doctor about medication refills and it is rare that anyone even answers the phone. When they do, they appear to be put out to speak to any patients and treat you like a bother. I gave them multiple chances over the past 3 years and my last interaction was the worst I've ever been treated by a \"medical professional.\"","6390125":"The staff is nice enough. However, I told them what I needed at 8:56 and at 9:45 they called me to the desk, I thought to be seen but no. that's when they gave me paper work to fill out. I sat for almost an hour to turn around and sit longer to fill out paperwork that I could have been filling out while I was sitting the first time. That was a complete waste of time and not efficient at all. There were people who were waiting before I even showed up and was still there as i finished my paper work they need a better system.","6392091":"This is an extremely convenient Vitamin Shoppe location that I was very happy to find existed. I love ordering online and picking up at this location. One time they ran out of a small bottle of magnesium and gave me the larger size for no extra charge. \n\nI really wish that the employees\/\"health enthusiasts\" wouldn't try to sell customers on their  subscription services.

Remember we shake hands!","6419177":"I have made 3 appointments with this place and for one reason or another, I have yet to be able to have gone for a visit. The first time they told me the DAY before my appointment that the doctor I was supposed to see was no longer available. The second time, they scheduled me for the wrong time. The third time, their automated system broke so no courtesy calls were sent. \n\nThird time's a charm. I'm finding a new doctor.","6423371":"Walked in to 5 staff members behind the desk that ignored me standing in front of them for a few minutes while they talked about there schedule.

Everyone is really friendly, knowledgeable & willing to help you. The staff seem very educated in the products they sell to the typical consumer.\nThis Vitamin Shop is located in Center City, right on the corner. It's a small shop. They are currently renovating there shop but they are still open and eager to help. A good place to stop if you need to pick up a much needed supplement or a certain vitamin.","6500818":"I really like this place and definitely prefer it to GNC... they have really good prices for protein and I actually can feel better about supporting my healthy lifestyle without breaking a budget.\n\nThe staff are helpful and friendly and approachable. I have found that going into GNC I get a little intimidated by employees because of my lack of knowledge on what I may be looking for and it makes me not want to buy anything or ask questions. At this Vitamin Shoppe in particular, I always feel like the staff are easier to talk to. \n\nSign up for their rewards card to get deals for stuff! I'll definitely be returning as needed.","6505226":"Vitamin Shop is a huge chain and offers nearly every supplement you can imagine.  Just be careful as some are animal derived (if you are a vegan - you gotta be really careful at TVS) and many come from lab created sources.\n\nA good place to pick up some Co-Q 10.  (I'm a big fan of my Co-Q.)\n\nThey are a huge chain - and if you get the membership card - there can be some good deals.","6543950":"I come to this Vitamin Shoppe weekly to purchase Quest bars.  They have a great selection of flavor and other protein bars like the One bar, which I think is a bit tastier than other nutrition bars. I've also tried the cookies that have a lot of protein, which I thought were okay.\n\nOverall, I have been the most impressed by the customer service from all of the cashiers. People who work here are friendly, knowledgable and go out of their way to help me, now that's good customer service!  They also have a points system where once you earn 100 points, you get a $5 discount!  Their everyday prices are reasonable too.","6557519":"I've been a customer here forever. I used to be a diehard GNC fan, but over time their corporate sales policies became a real turnoff, and since I discovered that both the Vitamin Shoppe and GNC will price match each other to gain sales, after bouncing back and forth to save myself money, I defaulted to the V.S. because they'll special order ANYthing for you, regardless of whether they sell it IN store or not. AND - if the online price they list is different from the IN-store price, they will look up the online price for you at time of purchase and give you the lower. \n            One of my pet peeves is when sales associates are trained for SALES and they talk as if they know what they're talking about, even if they don't. Calling someone on their ignorance is humiliating not only for them, but for me - don't make me do that to you. If you are unsure of a product or a side effect or a benefit, don't pretend you know just to sell something or to seem macho. The Vitamin Shoppe guys treat me as a familiar; they know I know my stuff, that if I have a question I will ask, and they don;t pretend to know things if they don't.\n          Their line of V.S. generics are spot on to the original products and the price is right. I like knowing that if I want it, they will get it for me, no problem. They are like friends I can count on. I still pop into GNC for sales and just to peruse what's happening during gold card week, but it's no longer the place that gets my big bucks. \n(Also, I really enjoy talking metal-geekspeak with the employees). Lastly, the sexism factor here is ZERO. That will bring me coming back EVERY time. And in the world of meathead-get-ripped supplements, that's a rarity.","6592610":"The staff is pretty knowledgeable.  Lots of choices.  The location is small, but they have a lot of things in stock.","6598633":"TERRIBLE!!!! The wait is extremely long.

There were ladders and boxes everywhere. I could hardly get through the store. When I finally finagled through the mess and got to the protein powder section they had such a small offering I couldn't find anything that worked for me. There was also a giant ladder in the way.\n\nI would recommend just avoiding this store in general because you cannot actually shop! Ordering online is easy and they have free shipping. I guess in a pinch if you were really desperate you could get a few things. \n\nI do have to say they had a nice selection of bars - if you can climb over the stuff in the way to look at them. I picked up some complete cookies cause I felt weird coming in and not buying anything since the store was so small. The guy who rang me up was really nice though, so I'm giving two stars for that. I will do everything I can to avoid this store in the future though,","6626317":"Agree with all the posts before mine. Rushed in, rushed out, lab tests not performed properly, horrible customer service, you name it.","6629607":"I think today was the last straw that I felt the need to write a review on Yelp.  It's a convenient location, especially if you work or live in Center City, but due to the rudeness of the employees, I recommend Whole Foods or Essene (or I guess GNC is somewhere nearby?).  I have gotten nonverbal gestures and grunts as I tell the employees to have a nice day; \"uh-huh\" instead of a simple \"you too.\"  Might seem like a small detail, but it's a smaller-size shop and I can easily take my business somewhere where I am greeted in a more friendly manner.  The plus side is the 50% off sales that they offer at times and a variety of items to choose from.  However, as is also what happened today, if an item is chosen to go on the top shelf, it will be over 8 feet high and you can't browse or look up ingredients to that item......iHerb is also a great website with better prices than Vitamin Shoppe.","6652727":"The customer service here is awesome.\n\nI buy mostly online, because of the great deals, but can't beat this location for awesome people who give you a smile, chat you up are quick and remember your name.  Love love love Sandra, and the Manager (I will come in and get your name and post it, you're too good - I've never had a chance to get your name... always making me feel good).  And I like treating myself to my \"Vitamin Shoppe Rewards\" here in person.\n\nGreat for homeopathic remedies when you need them, and usually there's a sale during the cold\/allergy seasons.","6655296":"The store manager Akeem could not have been more helpful. I will be back because of the amazing service.","6684908":"Dr. Johnson was nice, but the other staff members were rude and incompetent. They cancelled appointments, lost forms, made mistakes with scripts, and did not return phone calls. After they'd make a mistake, they would deny the mistake and become defensive. Awful, stay away, they do not care about patients.","6691693":"Abysmal service. They allow people to make an appointment only to wait and wait. The staff are unprofessional and uncaring. A great example of everything wrong with the medical service industry.","6694391":"I went here a couple of years ago for a check-up because I was new to the area and needed a local doctor. I was basically told that if I felt healthy I shouldn't come in for a check-up and got sent on my way. 2 years later I'm finding out that the doctor ordered some lab work and never sent the lab my insurance info, so now I have a $1500 lab bill. I tried to call the office (during business hours) but just got a voicemail. \nMoral of the story: Stay away! There are better doctors out there as well as office staff who know how to handle insurance.","6706988":"Extremely long wait times. I had a 2pm appointment and was told to be there early. I had a daughter who takes a 130 nap so I definitely wanted to come early. I showed up at 130 with my 2.5yo daughter and 7 week old son and had to wait until after 3pm to be seen! And the only reason I was taken back was because I complained to the front desk staff and the manager. I feel bad for anyone who needs to go here. The office staff wasn't rude but they certainly weren't nice or accommodating to me and my family. The dr also spent 2 minutes with me once I was taken back to see him. It was a complete joke.","6718690":"Made an appointment at 1pm and I'm still waiting 30 minutes later.  I made the appointment while I was on my lunch break.  Thanks for wasting my time.  Your professionalism and customer service is top NOTCH. Never again.","6721061":"I stopped coming to the office because of their support staff.  I was very sick with an upper respiratory infection that wasn't improving. I called the office to let them know and the person who answered the phone was very nasty with me when I asked advice on what I should do.  She made me come back into the office.  While I was waiting to see the doctor another patient came in, apparently someone who knew the girl who answers the phone.  I was SHOCKED when he came in and Mocked ME!   I knew it was me he was mocking for a few reasons:  1.  He used my exact wording from when I was speaking to nasty woman on the phone (and they both laughed) and 2.  She hushed him when he started to mock me.  I never complained about this and from the other reviews I've read, it seems like she's still at it.  This place is a disgrace.    I would never recommend it to anyone.  It's a shame, because the Doctor's are great.","6751015":"Dr Johnson has been great, the nurse I've dealt with has been great, most of the women who work the desk are great.....but Jennifer does not belong in any job that involves customer service.  I called to refill a prescription, when I called 24 hours later to see if it had been refilled Jennifer was extremely rude and began to tell me all the reasons I should wait 48 hours to have a prescription filled.  I explained to her that I had never taken a prescription regularly and did not know all the hoops I had to jump through.  She continued to try to \"prove me wrong\" instead of trying to help me deal with a frustrating situation.  Some people should not be in jobs that require thoughtfulness and reasoning.  I am in the process of finding a new primary care physician.","6796984":"The good news: I have had multiple physicians here over the years and have loved them all.\nThe bad news: I have had multiple physicians here but they keep leaving.\n\nOther than physician turnover, I have found this place to be a great medical practice.  This includes the office staff.  I do have to say that too often they don't answer the phone, but otherwise I have found them to be nothing but friendly and helpful.  I'm surprised by the negative review.","6810195":"I  the store! The staff has always been so helpful& knowledgeable regarding the millions of questions I ask. They also have rare return policy, within reason of course. Like I didnt like an essential oil I bought recently and they returned it w\/o hesitation .Also when I thought I bought a bad batch of thier raw honey they promptly exchanged for a new bottle. I am slowly evolving into a more natural organic lifestyle after repeated bad reactions and allergies to various over the counter beauty products, that now I make my own soaps, shampoos, beauty products all using great ingredients that I can trust from this store. I absolutely rave about their raw honey! It is my go to face wash, cleansing my hair, sweeting my teas,. And this honey has so countless health benifits! I wish more women knew about the powers of this raw honey so they'd ditch their chemical; poisonous commercial producuts that only strip them of beauty and turn to the wonders of raw natural honey found at this great store!","6835519":"Welcome to Worknet, where the schedule is made up and appointment times don't matter! My new job sent me here for a urine test and PPD and the whole experience was hellish. My appointment was for 11am but I was not called back for the urine sample until 12:45. I almost wet myself waiting since I drank a fair amount of water beforehand. When I told them this they really didn't care, and basically told me to leave if I didn't like it. \nThe only reason this shit hole gets an extra star is because the lady Sabrina who took my urine sample was very nice. She confirmed my suspicions that every day at Worknet is pretty much a clusterfuck, since they also handle walk-ins for on the job injuries. Pretty much the worst aspects of a doctor's office and an emergency room wrapped up into one horrible package. \nOh, and when I came back to get my PPD read, it was read by a medical assistant, and needed to be signed off by a doctor.  I was told this would happen some time the next day. I asked for a copy of my PPD once it is signed off and was told no. So you inject me with something and can't give me the documentation? What kind of bullshit is that?\nI loathe this place and pray I never get sent back.","6887882":"The staff has always been so helpful& knowledgeable regarding the millions of questions I ask.

The 2 people that were there when I went (the woman at the counter and the woman who took the blood) were the roodest people I've experienced in some time.  They were so extremely impatient and made you feel like you did something wrong if you asked them a question.\n\nThey are the type of people....who have been working there for a while, and don't explain anything to you, but talk to you as if you know everything they do (regarding the tests you are taking\/samples you are giving), and every question you ask them, they respond with a sign and make you feel like it was a stupid question.  I'll never go there again.  The people that work there hate their work (or lives) and exude those feelings towards the people that come in.","6941590":"I tried following the directions printed on my lab order by my physician. A series of time consuming and user unfriendly errors unfolded. Initially I tried to make an appointment online - the system crashed, and then said it was under review. Next I used the phone line, which went through but took a little longer given the prompts that were clear but multiple. I arrived 10 minutes prior to my appointment time and literally was one of 2 people at the lab office, the other patient was in the bathroom. I signed in expecting to be serviced immediately, but spent 5-10 minutes listening to the 2 lab workers discussing their uniform options. I finally went to the front desk and stood there until I was acknowledged and my paperwork was requested. I was sent pretty quickly back to one of the blood draw rooms, but the room had some very obvious and rather nauseating discoveries. Not only wasn't it spotlessly clean (which I expect in the place my blood is being drawn); there literally was a used glove and used bandages not in the trash but around the trash on the floor and hanging off and out of the trash can. This trash was actually was located right under and next to the patient chair used for lab draws. The actual blood draw was not too bad, the young lady was definitely experienced and gentle - that's why they get 2 stars; but otherwise I'll use another location in the future.","6989901":"I only come to this location because the parking is convenient. The service is terrible. First of all the women working there have no idea how insurance works or how to properly log it in to the system. On multiple occasions I have had trouble getting blood work done because the people here are so poorly trained they don't have any clue how to get in contact with billing. Second of all what ever happened to service with a smile. I have encountered several different women here all with abysmal attitudes. Finally it is ridiculous that I take time to make an appointment online and I am not seen anywhere close to that time. Every time I have been here there is only one person running the front desk and taking bloods and every time the blood draw is more painful than it should be."},"date":{"9430":"2009-03-03
